    <p>I’ve just started this a couple months ago. – <em>Jonathan</em>.</p>

<p>When thinking home sleep monitors, I wanted to reveiew practice changes I’ve made in the past couple years.</p>

<p>None of these changes are about making money. The point is that I can increase the ways I help patients. And that they are viable as part of my practice as a Family Doc.</p>

<p>Small practice innovations cover their investment costs and expand scope of practice. <strong>Cocky Strategic Idea-Guy</strong> (that’s me!) would like to add one more innovation: Home Sleep Monitors.</p>

<h2 id="home-monitors">Home Monitors</h2>

<p>For patients with a moderate to high pre-test suspicion of OSA, full polysomnagraphy can reasonably be replaced by home sleep studies. It has &gt; 90% sensitivity.  </p>

<ul>
  <li>Much shorter wait between diagnostic suspicion and evaluation. (Typically up to 2 months in my community now.) Could be a week.</li>
  <li>More comfortable/convenient than going to a lab.</li>
  <li>Much cheaper (No consult visit, Study price is ~1/4 a full night study)</li>
  <li>Allows some people who would refuse referral to still get evaluated.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reimbursementcosts">Reimbursement/Costs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Medicare 2012 Reimbursement for 95806: $183.80 (TC: $121.85; -26: $61.95)</li>
  <li>Local Commercial Payors: $234-273 (Source: Family Care Network, Bellingham)</li>
  <li>Device costs ~$2200.</li>
  <li>Supplies and interpretation and portal ~$100 per study.</li>
  <li>ROI: Need to do 10-15 studies to recoup cost.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coordination">Coordination</h2>

<p>I talked with a local sleep doc about potentially collaborating on interpretation and followup. His office was starting home sleep studies as well. He wasn’t interested in coordinating. Understandable.</p>

<h2 id="what-ive-learned-so-far">What I’ve learned so far</h2>

<p>I got a <a href="http://www.midmark.com/en-us/MedicalProducts/ECGSpiroHolterStressVitals/Pages/MidmarkSleepView.aspx">Midmark Sleepview</a> and it’s been pretty easy to setup and to use. I’ve done 4 studies so far and the average turnaround has been 5 business days for the interpretation. I don’t have it automated yet; it’s taking me about 10 minutes to set up the machine and 10 minutes to upload results. It’ll get faster. The results so far have made sense but it’s too early to see how effective I am with CPAP training, etc. I’m working on it…. </p>

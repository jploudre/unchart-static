    <p>I’m going to be doing a diabetic group visit – a dinner club.  </p>

<p>Why would I offer to give free food as part of a doctor visit?</p>

<ul>
  <li>By going over dinnertime, I can make it easier for diabetics with a job to stay on top of diabetes.</li>
  <li>Exemplify some healthy meals</li>
  <li>Time savings of group visits over individual visits give me more practice flexibility (open up appointment slots)</li>
  <li>Longer-time of group visit allows much more learning than routine visits.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have about 80 diabetics in my practice. I’m hoping to get about half to join a dinner club for a year. Good food, good conversation and good diabetic care.</p>

<h2 id="my-invitation-text">My invitation (text)</h2>

<p>I’m starting a <strong>diabetes ‘dinner club’</strong> that will meet every 3 months for a year.  This will be a group visit where you’ll get your labs done, related refills and a chance for one-on-one time with me. Like other doctor visits, if you have a co-pay, you’ll still have to do that. (Sorry, I don’t control the healthcare system!)</p>

<p>But, unlike a regular doctor visit, <strong>I’ll be providing dinner</strong> and we’ll have time as a group to eat  and discuss diabetes &amp; how to care for it. We’ll make something tasty (and appropriate for diabetes!) to eat. I’m doing this at dinnertime so that if you have a job you don’t have to take much/any time off to come to this longer visit.
I did group visits a few years ago and people really seemed to enjoy them. Sometimes it’s easier to learn from someone else’s questions.</p>

<p><strong>Time:</strong> 5:00 - 7:00 pm 
<strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, 4/3/2012
<strong>Where:</strong> At the Office
<strong>RSVP:</strong> Call and leave a message with my nurse Heather. 428-1700
I’m going to limit this to 8 people so call now to reserve a spot. </p>

<p>Hope you can come!
Dr. Jonathan Ploudre</p>

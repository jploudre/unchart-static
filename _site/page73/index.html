        More Dragon with e-MDs

    <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>I wrote recently about <a href="http://unchart.com/2011/using-dragon-with-e-mds/">Dragon 11 (not just medical) with e-MDs </a></p>

<p>So I’ve failed dictation multiple times in the past – I’d say I’ve given a real try at least 5 times in the last 6 years. Improvements helped but I still failed.:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-USB-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000AP1RE8/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1302575395&sr;=1-5">better microphone</a> helped. (I hate putting a headphone on and off. This looks like I’m on radio.)</li>
  <li>Making a custom targeted vocabulary (from my previous dictations) helped, too. It’s only 23K word but they are words that I actually say.</li>
</ol>

<p>But the error rate was always high-enough that it felt like it was more work than typing (definitely more error prone.) And I’d go crazy trying to get some sentence or word recognized.</p>

<p><strong>Using Dragon 11 has been a revelation. Much faster. More accurate.</strong> I enjoy using it! Feels somewhat like using a transcriptionist. </p>

<p>In terms of doing ‘real-time’ Visit Summaries, it’s still not part of my workflow. But it’s still great for complicated non-templatable visits.</p>

<p>In my last post, I thought about note navigation macros, but it feels pretty low priority right now. The main macro (which opens up notepad in place of free text and pastes back into free text) is totally useful all by itself.</p>

<p>So my setup: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Delete all the hotkeys in Dragon except Microphone On/off as Numberpad +</li>
  <li>Use Numberpad - in free text (my macro), or Numberpad + for in templates.</li>
</ol>

<p>I haven’t really used Dragon for messaging or order tracking since it’s not my current workflow. Maybe someday.</p>

  <p>Multitasking is generally a myth. People think they can multi-task but the reality is that all the tasks they are doing are taking a hit. In an <a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1977523,00.html">article in Time magazine</a> 97.5% of the general population are not successful at multi-tasking. So when faced with two tasks at once, say Driving and Texting, we’re more dangerous. The New York Times has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/19/technology/20090719-driving-game.html">great simulation of texting and driving</a>. It’s really easy to do without multi-tasking. But it becomes frantically difficult while doing two tasks.</p>

<p>Seriously, go spend a minute or two on the  test and see how you do.</p>

<h3 id="interruptions-and-multitasking">Interruptions and Multitasking</h3>

<p>So if we don’t really multitask then interruptions need to be reconsidered. Are they stealing attention and concentration? Are we creating ‘distracted doctoring’? I’m sure no reasonable patient would be cool with his doctor texting while she writes a prescription. Yet we accept interruptions all the time. This has impact on usability/simplicity. Software that is tuned for faster performance of the doctor is probably safer. Faster task completion reduces the chance that we’ll be interrupted or tempted into multi-tasking. When doing complex tasks, it <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20819867">can take a doctor about 10 seconds to resume</a> after interruption. When you add dozens of interruptions a day, there’s a real impact on performance (and life-enjoyment.)</p>

<p>So how do you reduce interruptions?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid ‘real-time’ documenting: Patients will interrupt you while you’re documenting.</li>
  <li>Speed up common actions (macros) so you can complete them quicker.</li>
  <li>Batching non-clinical work (do before work, at lunch, etc). Downside: less <em>flow</em> for your nurse and patients not currently at the clinic.</li>
  <li>Respect your nurses’s attention, too.</li>
  <li>Stock needed items in the room (Seriously, leaving the room regularly is a huge timewaster.)</li>
  <li>Exploit messaging whenever possible. E-mail gets checked all day long but avoids  interruptions.</li>
</ul>

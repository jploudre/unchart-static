    <p>I started doing CGM about 1.5 years ago but never posted. – <em>Jonathan</em></p>

<h2 id="cgm-overview">CGM Overview</h2>

<p>Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) allows for better understanding in hard to control <em>insulin-dependent</em> diabetics. It checks a reading every 5 minutes for 3 days, it’s then downloaded and we can use it to adjust isulin and improve diabetic control.</p>

<p>This is a disruptive technology – as a Family Doc I potentially can do a better job with complicated diabetes control because I have better data from the patient. This is a technology that allows me to broaden the scope of problems I manage before I get to referral.</p>

<h3 id="nuts-and-bolts">Nuts and Bolts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Why: A1c control is one of our main clinical benchmarks for Meaningful Use.</li>
  <li>Cost: Machine is ~$1200. Sensors are $40 each.</li>
  <li>Coverage: Our carriers cover it. There’s $120-200 charge for patient training/explanation (that’s outside of the visit E&amp;M;). There’s also a $30 interpretation fee after it’s removed.</li>
  <li>ROI: The first ~7 patients cover the cost of the machine, if we have ~$200 charges and $40 costs per patient.</li>
  <li>Quality: Allows better diabetic management in insulin patients.</li>
  <li>Time: Most of the process will be nurse driven, like, say, PFTs.</li>
</ul>

<p>I bought a <a href="http://professional.medtronicdiabetes.com/hcp-products/ipro2">Meditronic iPro Continuous Glucose Monitor</a>.</p>

<p>Since I’ve been doing it, I’ve found it to be very useful for seeing exactly where/how sugars are out of control. Essentially every patient has had one significant insight that helped improve diabetes. In Washington State, I think about 70% Private Insurance has coverage. So that’s been a barrier to doing it. For patients who don’t have coverage, if they might do it several times, I suggest that they consider buying a personal CGM out of pocket. Like <a href="http://www.dexcom.com/seven-plus">Dexcom Seven Plus</a>. It won’t be long for someone to make an iPhone compatible personal CGM…..</p>

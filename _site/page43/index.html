    <p>A recent study hits too close to home:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21685794">“Deskilling and adaptation among primary care physicians using two work innovations”</a> says, essentially, that as primary care docs try to use innovation like EHRs and clinical guidelines, we become less trustworthy to our patients, less confident.</p>

<p>Or as I’ve put it elsewhere here: I don’t want to become my patient’s data-entry-technician. I feel like a push to gettting better visit summaries has led me to pay less attention to my patients and to rush through patient education.</p>

<p>I’m considering doing a brief video about deskilling. Here’s my manifesto/script.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Jonathan. I’m a doctor and a geek.</p>

<p>13 years ago, I went to Medical School to become a generalist, a “personal physician”.</p>

<p>For 7 years, I learned about patients and diseases and treatments.</p>

<p>I love talking to people and trying to help. </p>

<p>As a geek, I’ve been exploiting technology in doctoring.</p>

<p>It’s my external brain that lets me know and do things I couldn’t otherwise.</p>

<p>With technology, I could practice like a modern doctor.</p>

<p>When I heard about Meaningful Use, I knew I’d be a shoe-in because I’m geek and because I know my EHR like the back of my hand.</p>

<p>Still, just to be sure, I made macros to polish my usage so I could do Meaningful Clicks and still focus on the people I care for.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I only have so much attention bandwidth: when I’m focusing on clicking a button I can’t be focusing on a facial expression.</p>

<p>Even with a respected EHR and a macro-enabled workflow, Meaningful Use is tarnishing my bedside manner.</p>

<p>Healthcare tech is de-skilling me and making me into a data-technician.</p>

<p>We ought to stop deskilling – we all need thinking doctors, not checklist completers. </p>

<p>We need tools that respect physician attention and keep doctors human.</p>

<p>We need to automate and simplify necessary data capture so docs can focus on patients.</p>

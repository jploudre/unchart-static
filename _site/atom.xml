   <title>Happy 2nd Birthday, UnChart</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2013/happy-2nd-birthday-unchart/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-29T19:14:30-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2013/happy-2nd-birthday-unchart</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been about 2 years since I started UnChart. I thought I’d do a run through of the numbers. I love analytics. There’s been about 9500 visits, averaging just under 4 minutes on the site. About 5000 unique visitors. Here’s my traffic over the 2 years. That spike in the middle was the Meaningful Use Stage 2 Summary for Providers that John Crankshaw and I did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-29-at-6.36.59-PM-300x69.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top 4 browsers were IE, Chrome, Firefox and Safari. In that order. I find that interesting because for several years I have complained to e-MDs that Portal doesn’t layout appropriately in Modern Browsers. Less than half of my visitors use Internet Explorer. &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/encourage-e-mds-to-fix-portal-usability/&quot;&gt;That campaign to convince e-MDs to fix portal usability&lt;/a&gt; was probably the first time SupportCenter had been used systematically to raise awareness with e-MDs. Interesting coincidence, a couple weeks later, the exact fix that I had recommended went out to Portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-29-at-6.41.45-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-29-at-6.41.45-PM-300x245.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is now a significant source of traffic – I’ve had about a couple thousand visitors from Google links. (Comparatively: for me, Bing is 20x smaller. No other search engine shows up.) There are no advertisements (other than, I guess, stuff I advertise for myself.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-content&quot;&gt;The Content…..&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote most of the posts here. I’ve definitely had help from a number of other people who’ve shared their work. Thanks Chris, Bill, Sara, John, Chat, Keith, and a few others. THere have been 120 posts. Some are articles, others are just placeholders for crystal reports or other downloads. Since I’ve started teaching on my ‘day off’ last July, the site has been less active. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My top posts: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/unchart-visit-summary/&quot;&gt;Unchart Visit Summary&lt;/a&gt;. (Which now has about 3500 uses/week!) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/stage-2-proposed-guidelines/&quot;&gt;Stage 2 Proposed Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; (the spike of traffic, handout was downloaded ~800 times) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2011/e-mds-macros/&quot;&gt;e-MDs Macros&lt;/a&gt; (My tool for making daily work faster) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2011/where-to-start-with-macros-and-e-mds/&quot;&gt;Where to Start with macros and e-MDs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some time optimizing the site. I like speed. A typical page loads in 2.5 seconds. Hopefully that makes browsing more enjoyable for people. 95% of visit are straight browsing (not using search.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;year-3&quot;&gt;Year 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest news for the next year on the site is that John Crankshaw is joining me on this. He’s already on the sidebar! I’ve got some other project that I’m working on – in particular an app that helps new MAs do refills via protocol. More about that soon…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a third year medical student at &lt;a href=&quot;http://pnwu.edu&quot;&gt;Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000BQUKFpgQ1Tk/s/870/wild-horse-mustang-Mwhrs0966.jpg&quot;&gt;Mighty Mustangs&lt;/a&gt;! I currently live in Mount Vernon, WA and am stumbling along as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://theandrewmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Doogie-Friends-doogie-howser-md-2676324-370-278.jpg&quot;&gt;Junior Doctor&lt;/a&gt;…my wife’s most endearing pet name…at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skagitvalleyhospital.org/&quot;&gt;Skagit Valley Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very happily married to my beautiful and creative wife, &lt;a href=&quot;http://j29eleven.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Laura&lt;/a&gt;, who gave me the world’s cutest and strongest-willed kid, Parker J. Life as a daddy, husband, medical student, friend, son, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1126273-18-year-old-katie-collier-overcomes-cancer-on-her-way-to-mcdonalds-all-american&quot;&gt;sibling&lt;/a&gt; and more…can be a bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.staceyreid.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Juggler.png&quot;&gt;hectic&lt;/a&gt;, but I love my life and am so blessed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great state of Washington has always been my home, living in Kent, Seattle, Yakima, and now in Mount Vernon. I did have a quick stint in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hotelanacapri.com/upload/image/alhambra-5.jpg&quot;&gt;Granada, Spain&lt;/a&gt; while a junior at the University of Washington…&lt;a href=&quot;http://pics4.city-data.com/cpicc/cfiles199.jpg&quot;&gt;Go Dawgs!!&lt;/a&gt;…and subsequently got bit by the travel bug, which unfortunately isn’t too conducive with the med student lifestyle and non-existent salary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t claim the prestigeous title of Geek, like my Unchart.com superiors, but hopefully they can help me change that. I did grow up in the world of dial-up AOL, giving me madd middle-school &lt;a href=&quot;http://pennalumniblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/aim-chat.gif&quot;&gt;AIM flirting skillz&lt;/a&gt;, and I was in undergrad when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/uploaded_files/image/facebook-2004_11934.jpg&quot;&gt;TheFacebook&lt;/a&gt; made its debut. I like computers and I kind of know how to use them. Let’s do this!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Leadership or whining?</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/leadership-or-whining/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-21T11:25:54-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/leadership-or-whining</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First, some background. A few days ago, the AAFP released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/membership/initiatives/nps/patientcare/changing.html&quot;&gt;statement against expanding roles for Nurse Practitioners&lt;/a&gt;. The tagline: &lt;em&gt;Ensuring a quality, physician-led team for every patient.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/09/PCMH-AAFPInfographic.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/17-bar-chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; One Page AAFP Infographic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nurse practitioners have started to respond. CKRN wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://ckrn.tumblr.com/post/31940128969/nurse-practitioners-scope-of-practice-and-turf&quot;&gt;Nurse Practitioners, Scope of Practice and turf.&lt;/a&gt; (Go ahead and read it, I’ll wait here. )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Berstein says &lt;a href=&quot;http://futureoffamilymedicine.blogspot.com/2012/09/patients-are-real-leaders-in-patient.html?m=0&quot;&gt;Patients should lead care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;medical-management--team-leadership&quot;&gt;Medical management ≠ Team Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think these discussions are confusing leadership and management. In the last 100 years since the Flexner Report, physicians have assumed leadership of much of healthcare. Nearly all physicians can get leadership roles if they are willing to commit time/energy.That’s a correlation, though. It’s not that medical school and residency trained us in team leadership. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AAFP says, “Doctors bring broader and deeper expertise to the diagnosis and treatment of all health problems. Doctors are trained to provide complex diagnoses and develop comprehensive plans to treat them.” That’s technically true compared to Nurse Practitioners. But that’s confusing management of medical care and leadership of patient-centered care. (This is where I like Dr. Bernstein’s idea that patients should be leading – they should be the best advocates.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correlation is not causation. Physician training did not make me a team leader. The talents/skills/activities that helped me get into Stanford for college or ETSU for medical school are the foundations for being a leader now. Nearly everything I’ve learned about teamwork or leadership has happened outside of my formal medical education. I learned as a Peace Corps Volunteer or as a volunteer coordinator. In three years of residency I had lectures about practice management. But it was a tacked-on experience  – we weren’t really going to get to practice any of those topics on the current residency clinic. (Who’s going to let a resident decide budgeting priorities?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t really need that much ‘leadership’. It’s ridiculously simple to see failure across modern healthcare. Healthcare teams need skills at getting things done for patients. Expanding roles for Nurse Practitioners is a non-sequitir for me. It’s unrelated to whether teams are well-run or not. Just like being a physician-owner is unrelated to whether a clinic’s business is efficient. Some are. Some aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So personally, this feels like protectionism and whining from the AAFP. Let’s provide exceptional care. Let’s keep advocating for innovation and limit the flaws of modern healthcare. If we excel, patients will choose with their feet. There’s more than one way to do things right — I respect Nurse Practitioners’ for trying to create their own way of patient-centered medical care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;postscript&quot;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, I heard what I thought was a &lt;em&gt;damning condemnation&lt;/em&gt; of the AMA and physicians in general. OK, this is unsourced. But in all the discussion of 1990s Health Care Reform, not a single statement from the AMA was about patient-centered issues. It was all about physician reimbursement. Protecting physician rights, etc. All about protecting turf. Hmm, why am I remembering this anecdote now?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Home Sleep Monitor</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/home-sleep-monitor/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-07T16:17:56-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/home-sleep-monitor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve just started this a couple months ago. – &lt;em&gt;Jonathan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When thinking home sleep monitors, I wanted to reveiew practice changes I’ve made in the past couple years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Practice Innovation&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Revenue&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Cost&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fluoride&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$8600&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Under $1000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Continuous Glucose Monitor&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$3400&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;~$1600&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$4600&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1600&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Zio Patch&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$100&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$100 (Delayed for Medicare T-Code)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these changes are about making money. The point is that I can increase the ways I help patients. And that they are viable as part of my practice as a Family Doc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small practice innovations cover their investment costs and expand scope of practice. &lt;strong&gt;Cocky Strategic Idea-Guy&lt;/strong&gt; (that’s me!) would like to add one more innovation: Home Sleep Monitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;home-monitors&quot;&gt;Home Monitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For patients with a moderate to high pre-test suspicion of OSA, full polysomnagraphy can reasonably be replaced by home sleep studies. It has &amp;gt; 90% sensitivity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Much shorter wait between diagnostic suspicion and evaluation. (Typically up to 2 months in my community now.) Could be a week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More comfortable/convenient than going to a lab.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Much cheaper (No consult visit, Study price is ~1/4 a full night study)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows some people who would refuse referral to still get evaluated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reimbursementcosts&quot;&gt;Reimbursement/Costs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medicare 2012 Reimbursement for 95806: $183.80 (TC: $121.85; -26: $61.95)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local Commercial Payors: $234-273 (Source: Family Care Network, Bellingham)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Device costs ~$2200.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supplies and interpretation and portal ~$100 per study.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ROI: Need to do 10-15 studies to recoup cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coordination&quot;&gt;Coordination&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked with a local sleep doc about potentially collaborating on interpretation and followup. His office was starting home sleep studies as well. He wasn’t interested in coordinating. Understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-ive-learned-so-far&quot;&gt;What I’ve learned so far&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midmark.com/en-us/MedicalProducts/ECGSpiroHolterStressVitals/Pages/MidmarkSleepView.aspx&quot;&gt;Midmark Sleepview&lt;/a&gt; and it’s been pretty easy to setup and to use. I’ve done 4 studies so far and the average turnaround has been 5 business days for the interpretation. I don’t have it automated yet; it’s taking me about 10 minutes to set up the machine and 10 minutes to upload results. It’ll get faster. The results so far have made sense but it’s too early to see how effective I am with CPAP training, etc. I’m working on it…. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Continuous Glucose Monitors</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/continuous-glucose-monitors/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-07T14:52:29-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/continuous-glucose-monitors</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started doing CGM about 1.5 years ago but never posted. – &lt;em&gt;Jonathan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cgm-overview&quot;&gt;CGM Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) allows for better understanding in hard to control &lt;em&gt;insulin-dependent&lt;/em&gt; diabetics. It checks a reading every 5 minutes for 3 days, it’s then downloaded and we can use it to adjust isulin and improve diabetic control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a disruptive technology – as a Family Doc I potentially can do a better job with complicated diabetes control because I have better data from the patient. This is a technology that allows me to broaden the scope of problems I manage before I get to referral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nuts-and-bolts&quot;&gt;Nuts and Bolts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why: A1c control is one of our main clinical benchmarks for Meaningful Use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cost: Machine is ~$1200. Sensors are $40 each.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coverage: Our carriers cover it. There’s $120-200 charge for patient training/explanation (that’s outside of the visit E&amp;amp;M;). There’s also a $30 interpretation fee after it’s removed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ROI: The first ~7 patients cover the cost of the machine, if we have ~$200 charges and $40 costs per patient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quality: Allows better diabetic management in insulin patients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time: Most of the process will be nurse driven, like, say, PFTs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/09/Simple2Start.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://professional.medtronicdiabetes.com/hcp-products/ipro2&quot;&gt;Meditronic iPro Continuous Glucose Monitor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’ve been doing it, I’ve found it to be very useful for seeing exactly where/how sugars are out of control. Essentially every patient has had one significant insight that helped improve diabetes. In Washington State, I think about 70% Private Insurance has coverage. So that’s been a barrier to doing it. For patients who don’t have coverage, if they might do it several times, I suggest that they consider buying a personal CGM out of pocket. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dexcom.com/seven-plus&quot;&gt;Dexcom Seven Plus&lt;/a&gt;. It won’t be long for someone to make an iPhone compatible personal CGM…..&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>ROI for WelchAllyn SpotVitals LXi</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/roi-for-welchallyn-spotvitals-lxi/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-07T13:29:44-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/roi-for-welchallyn-spotvitals-lxi</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I put together this analysis. I don’t know that it’s still accurate. I believe the WelchAllyn SpotVitals is over-priced but it still has a reasonable ROI given that it really can speed up vitals. – &lt;em&gt;Jonathan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spot-vitals-lxi&quot;&gt;Spot Vitals LXi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connects directly into e-MDs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Takes about 15 seconds to do BP/HR vitals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can connect to a electronic scale so weight gets imported, too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Costs $2000 - $3500 (quick googling, not comparison shopping.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;direct-roi&quot;&gt;Direct ROI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In setting of  possible MA turnover, reduces BP variability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assume it saves 30 seconds (fast BP, less manual transcription), that translates to more than 2 full days of staff work. About 2000 vitals per side of the clinic monthly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;ROI 1.5 years&lt;/strong&gt;. More or less depending on how much time it actually saves. I think 30 seconds is low)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;indirect-roi&quot;&gt;Indirect ROI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More efficient MAs would mean nurses would not have to room as many patients. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce Doctor waiting on rooming patients&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve pt satisfaction (quicker rooming)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve eye contact/friendliness of rooming (MAs wouldn’t have to look at computer nearly as much.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thigh cuffs would reduce temptation for MAs to get inaccurate BPs in order to save time of walking to central pod.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eliminate transcription errors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve MA/Nurse Morale with less ‘scut work’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;ROI 3-6 months&lt;/strong&gt; given all the ripple benefits.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fitting the WelchAllyn Spot Vitals into e-MDs</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/fitting-the-welchallyn-spot-vitals-into-e-mds/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-07T10:14:38-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/fitting-the-welchallyn-spot-vitals-into-e-mds</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/08/450x0-E1-2-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; After I attested for 2011 Meaningful Use, my group decided to have the doc decide on some of the ‘re-investments’ in our practice. The second thing I got was the WelchAllyn SpotVitals Lxi. (Bigger monitors for reception was first.) I had been interested in this for at least a couple years. A while back, I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/welchallyn-spotvitals-lxi/&quot;&gt;video on using the SpotVitals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated vitals addresses a few different issues for my practice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using an interface eliminates typo errors (which can cause embarrassing mistakes graphing, say, weight.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By checking blood pressure on the way up, the SpotVitals is faster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By speeding up vitals it can allow the nurse/MA to focus more on the person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clinical Research shows that labile blood pressure readings are improved with automatic vitals over manual vitals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduces inter-staff variability in blood pressures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By having a central station, it’s much better stocked (every single cuff size is handy, no having to walk for a thigh cuff.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, sweet, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, reality hasn’t quite worked that way. The SpotVitals is expensive so you don’t just order one per nurse. We got our first one (without O2 Sat) for about $1700. It’s an extra $1300 to add O2 Sat. WelchAllyn’s milking this, if you ask me. The price is off by an order of magnitude. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitor-wheres-innovation/&quot;&gt;same problem with Welch-Allyn’s Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e-MDs has an interface – that’s why we bought this specific mdoel. &lt;em&gt;It’s supported.&lt;/em&gt; But it’s not really. The interface is a hack outside of e-MDs.It adds enough friction to eliminate the usefulness. The process is: Open Interface, Find Pt, Get Vitals, Close Interface, Open e-MDs, Find Pt, Drop in vitals. If the interface was within e-MDs you could cut the number of steps in half. And although documentation says the interface also works with compatible scales, it’s been broken for a few years according several users. (Thanks Keith for saving me money on a wasted scale!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the machine is expensive, we’ve been re-working clinical processes. Lately we’ve been trying doing vitals out in the waiting room. There are some communication issues between staff. On our next pilot, we’re going to add a few ‘rooms’ to our clinic dashboard. There will be ‘Vitals-Room’ and ‘Vitals Done’ so clinical staff can tell where a pt is in the process (and if there’s a backup, they can route around it.) My goal has been to help my staff decide what they want (not tell them.) So we’re still trying different things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/09/vitalsbackground-300x185.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the interface doesn’t work for efficient workflow, I’m building a new ‘pseudo-interface’. This will pop up from within a patient’s chart in e-MDs. I’m working with my staff to figure out the best place to put this. I’m trying a couple different things to make this work. First, much larger font-size so they can see typos better. The left side of this maps to where the vitals are on the machine. (Faster for staff, less cognitive-load so less error prone.) Tabbing through fields works in the order that they work (Again, faster). The results will be put into e-MDs where there’s full details – for example, which arm for the blood pressure. So we simplify input for reliability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to help test this,  &lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;you can drop me an e-mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Recommended: SpeechWare 3 in 1 Microphone</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/recommended-speechware-3-in-1-microphone/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-27T22:43:17-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/recommended-speechware-3-in-1-microphone</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Chris O’Grady for pointing this out to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I’ve struggled with Dragon. I think I’ve failed half a dozen times. With honest attempts – where I tried something different to make it work. A newer version. A better microphone. More training. More customized vocabulary. A newer version. A better microphone. etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enunciation still is the key.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dictation will never be complete magic for me because I misspeak and slur. But a few years of typing has helped me dicate better – I’m more telegraphic and less rambly.   Within the limits of my enunciation, I thought my setup was working pretty darn well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dragon 11.5 (Not Medical)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/c01u/&quot;&gt;Samson C01U&lt;/a&gt; microphone on a stand. (Respected for Podcasting. Great bang for buck)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Custom Vocabulary made from my old dictations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris takes a different approach: He uses Dragon Medical Version (which costs &amp;gt; $1000) and has a SpeechWare 3-in-1 Microphone (the highest rated table mike.) I prefer a table microphone, like Chris, because I hate taking the headset on and off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to buy a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knowbrainer.com/NewStore/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=402&amp;idcategory;=58&quot;&gt;$279 Speechware Mic from Knowbrainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/06/speechware1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I was surprised. I recreated a profile (pro tip: Any time you change Dragon Versions, your computer or your microphone, start a new profile. It’s work but it makes sure that each part is being maximized.) And the performance is much better. I still slur certain words but it felt that nearly all of my errors are either slurring or words that aren’t in my custom dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Dragon 12  is out with better accuracy. I’m using some of my Meaningful Use money to optimize my Dragon setup. A newer computer (mine’s pushing 5 years old) and newer Dragon, I’m hoping this will really rock….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d recommend the Speechware TableMike for Docs using Dragon daily. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am still in the process of turning my office into another exam room. Now that I use an electronic health record, I don’t really actually need a physical office during most of the day. I don’t tend to dictate during the middle of the day so giving up my office is not a big hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with side projects like this, is finding time to do them. Yesterday afternoon I had a few hours while I was on call and so I got a table and have put it together.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ideal Panel Size Report</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/ideal-panel-size-report/"/>
   <updated>2012-06-08T10:59:57-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/ideal-panel-size-report</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few years ago the AAFP had an article, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aafp.org/fpm/2007/0400/p44.html&quot;&gt;How Many Patients Can One Doctor Manage?&lt;/a&gt;. This report can be used for dicussions about relative panels in a practice. Which doctors have availability that matches up with their assigned panels? Who is over-paneled? Who is under-paneled?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This crystal report for e-MDs has 4 different tables that you can use to determine the answers to those questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first table has the number of distinct patients assigned to a doctor with visits/invoices in the last 2 years. (People use different timeframes from 1-3 years typically when defining active patients.) &lt;em&gt;So, for our practice certain types of visits, like prenatal visits, don’t show up here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second table shows the number of visit/invoices that the patients had in the past 2 years (regardless of continuity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third table shows the number of visits/invoices that the provider gave in the past 2 years (regardless of continuity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the last table shows the number of continuity visit/invoices for the providers and patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/06/ideal-panel-size-data.rpt_.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Ideal Panel Size Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real question for a group: &lt;strong&gt;Could you use this kind of data to make decisions about how to manage panel sizes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious what counts as a visit/invoice? No list is perfect. But here’s the CPTs embedded in the report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; &#39;99245&#39;,&#39;99201&#39;, &#39;99202&#39;, &#39;99203&#39;, &#39;99204&#39;,&#39;99205&#39;,

   <title>Consultation Theater</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/consultation-theater/"/>
   <updated>2012-05-30T22:54:49-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/consultation-theater</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while back a college friend turned me on to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx&quot;&gt;Strengthsfinder&lt;/a&gt;. My strengths are Strategic, Ideation, Input, Learner and Self-Assurance. I can identify with other strengths but these fit, too. Ideation is Strengthsfinder terminology for a person who loves coming up with and thinking about ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s definitely me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our group is starting to think about re-investing Meaningful Use money. We’re trying a simplified process of deciding (it’s time-consuming to get a large consensus). My thought was to make it “innovative but not foolish.” Now, when I start talking about innovation, people think I’m talking about tech. I do love tech but I like how Bell Labs President Mervin Kelly described innovation: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-22/book-review-the-idea-factory-by-jon-gertner&quot;&gt;Cheaper, or Better or Both&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m looking for things that make our care cheaper or better (or both) and are not foolish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/welchallyn-spotvitals-lxi/&quot;&gt;WelchAllyn Spot Vitals LXi&lt;/a&gt; helps making rooming faster (that’s cheaper via less time) and has the potential to reduce variability of readings (that’s better) and our clinic has about 4000 visits a month (so it’ll be really used. Practical!) There have been some questions about reliability of readings at Mid-State Health but I’ve got to try one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; Bigger Monitors for our Receptionists (&lt;a href=&quot;http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l;=en&amp;s;=bsd&amp;cs;=04&amp;sku;=320-2943&amp;amp;~ck=baynoteSearch&amp;baynote;_bnrank=3&amp;baynote;_irrank=0&quot;&gt;23 inch Dell Monitors for $180&lt;/a&gt;). By seeing more allows receptionists to work slightly faster. (Cheaper Checkins). Screens are more energy
efficience (cheaper). Larger screen will allow showing multiple schedules. More monitor space will be nice for morale, too. Not Foolish: These will be used continuously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my third idea is my doozy. Since i spend most of my time with my laptop near my nurse (intentional plan to allow better interuption and informal conversation), I’m not sure I really need my offices. So I’ve decided I should make a consultation theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-consultation-theater&quot;&gt;The Consultation Theater&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several parts to this idea. Back in the day, doctors used to use their offices to have conversations and consultations. After a lengthy consultation, you might go the the exam room to continue the visit and back to the office for the final plan. Not super ‘lean’ but it allows a more comfortable discussion. HIPAA has long killed the old version – at least for me. I could never keep a completely privacy-aware desk space. I’ve been interested in doing a better job with patient education via videos. But not everyone has youtube or internet. Thus the consultation theater is born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m imagining my desk in a corner (I have a Dragon Dictation Setup with my desktop PC). The main space will have a kitchen table with 4 chairs – enough for the vast majority of discussions I do. I’m hoping the make the feel ‘homey’ where we can sit around a table and discuss what to do. Maybe I’ll have a way to brew Tea or Coffee. Or possibly pop popcorn.  I’ll use this room for certain types of visits (Follow up from an MRI Scan, Follow up starting an antidepressnant, etc). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theater-wise, I plan a large TV mounted on the wall for video or to show Digital XR. I’ll get an iPad and an AppleTV to wirelesly show info on the TV. On the iPad I’ll sometimes mirror over e-MDs from my desktop, when it’s needed. The iPad will be loaded with videos that I commonly recommend. Sometimes I’ll use the theater for some simple brief education (Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor, Info about starting certain types of medications.) In some visits I’ll try to start the education part earlier and go work on great patient instructions in my Visit Summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Consultation-Theaters aren’t as well known as clock-radios or  camera-phones or chocalate-peanut butter. But I think this combo has some real potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Sweeney of Mid State Health wrote this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows normal vs new patients per month. It also includes distinct patients in that time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Portal Patients (email and expiration dates)</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s another report by Bill Sweeney from Mid-State Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/05/311131.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill creates awesome flat file reports. This is just begging for some simple list work in  Excel (See my &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/data-driven-practice/&quot;&gt;Data-Driven Practice&lt;/a&gt; page). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my practice we didn’t fully realize how expiration dates worked. We used 1 year later – now patients portal is expiring. We need to change the date to a later one. I think we’re going to use a macro to loop through and update expiration dates. It’ll be the &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/macro-to-add-flowsheets-in-e-mds/&quot;&gt;same technique I used to add preventive flowsheet&lt;/a&gt; by looping through a list of accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Reduce Access Violations with Time Synchronization</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/reduce-access-violations-with-time-synchronization/"/>
   <updated>2012-05-15T08:22:08-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/reduce-access-violations-with-time-synchronization</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Jeff Grabenstein, MD, of Family Doctors of Oak Ridge. He’s been exploring this lately and wrote this summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff’s Current Recommendation (Free):  &lt;a href=&quot;http://timesynctool.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; NetTime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;daily-frustration-with-access-violations&quot;&gt;Daily frustration with access violations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a user of e-MDs solution series since 2000.  Many years ago I learned that I needed to know as much about computer hardware as my IT specialists did.  I have seen many changes in e-MDs and it supporting hardware.  I have tried to keep my hardware at or beyond their minimum requirements.  Somewhere in the transition to their version 7.0 and greater and with the inclusion of Windows 7 my network began to notice more connection failures.  I have made all of the e-MDs suggested changes but I would continue to have between 2 to 4 connection failures on my Windows 7 client every hour.  The rest of the office is running Windows XP and they would have about 2 to 4 connection failures a day for each client.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My IT security guru told me that one of the nice things about Windows server 2008 is that it can update its time over the internet and be sure that all of the network computers have the same time.  This was the first that I had heard about syncing all of the clocks on a domain to one central “time server”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are limits to Windows Time Servers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/939322&quot;&gt;Microsoft KB article&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;measuring-time-variation&quot;&gt;Measuring Time Variation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I could replace my windows 2003 server domain controller I found a freeware network clock analysis tool &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greyware.com/software/domaintime/instructions/tools/lmcheck.asp&quot;&gt;LMcheck &lt;/a&gt;from a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greyware.com&quot;&gt;greyware &lt;/a&gt;that sells a program, Domain Time II, to help automate the task of domain time keeping.  My analysis revealed that my domain had tremendous variance its computer time from one computer to the next.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Worst Variance:   00 000 00:00:02.192	&amp;gt;2 secs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually found another freeware program called &lt;a href=&quot;http://timesynctool.com/&quot;&gt;NetTime&lt;/a&gt; that I have since installed.  I have set up one server to be my time server.  It updates the domain time from the internet every 15 minutes.  The other members of my domain then sync their clocks to this “time server” every 20 minutes.  Some people feel that using the internet to set domain times is a security risk.  There are companies that sell domain time servers that update their clocks from GPS systems or the cell phone network.  These devices cost around $3000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I have implemented this time sync I have at most about 1 access violation a day on my Windows 7 client and the Windows XP clients have not had any access violations.  Yesterday I did not have a single access violation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Visit Summary 7.2.1</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/visit-summary-7-2-1/"/>
   <updated>2012-05-14T21:40:25-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/visit-summary-7-2-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been just over a year since I was appalled at the default Visit Summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original visit summary disengages a patient in her care. It sets up barriers like 3/4 of a page of junk before the actual content begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that night as a proof of concept, I &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/visit-summary-cleanup-1-0/&quot;&gt;cleaned up the Visit Summary&lt;/a&gt;. I started using this for my own personal summaries by redirecting e-MDs stylesheet to my own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to share this with other people, I had to set up a webserver. So a month later I set up my &lt;a href=&quot;/unchart-visit-summary/&quot;&gt;Unchart Visit Summary&lt;/a&gt;. Initially I required payments to get the installation instructions. Mostly because I didn’t want to start doing a bunch of tech support. Much to my surprise, some people actually paid me. After a few months, I had gotten enough help to pay my server costs that I made donation optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After one of my brief downtimes, I also set up directions for &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/visit-summary-self-hosting/&quot;&gt;self-hosting the summary&lt;/a&gt; for people who didn’t want to rely on a server they didn’t control. Over the last year I got 99% uptime. Which is kinda lousy but I learned a lot. I’ve now got a 15 step server upgrade process. And I’ve accumulated several testing procedures to limit errors. I think I may get 99.95% this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that I’ve finished my adjustments for 7.2.1 (and e-MDs has made a redesign of their initial summary), where are we at?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;major-improvements-from-e-mds&quot;&gt;Major improvements from e-MDs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best improvements from e-MDs center on making the information more approachable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reordered problems so names came before ICD codes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cleaned up med list info (No RxNorm Codes, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduced visual complexity by turning tables into lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;main-ongoing-problems-from-e-mds&quot;&gt;Main Ongoing problems from e-MDs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legibility (10 point san-serif font)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They use background colors for bars but these don’t print right (instead get boxes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;main-improvements-from-unchart-summary&quot;&gt;Main improvements from Unchart Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Headline and text fonts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Larger 12 point font size to increase readability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More specific use of white space to direct attention. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cleaner appearance. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removal of HPI (now an option from e-MDs) allows more visit summaries to be available at the visit (with an incomplete note.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Using e-mail to increase panel size</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/using-e-mail-to-increase-panel-size/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-16T22:43:21-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/using-e-mail-to-increase-panel-size</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After doing some practice innovations (&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/group-visit-invitation/&quot;&gt;group visits are restarting&lt;/a&gt;, I’m &lt;a href=&quot;/?s=abpm&quot;&gt;undiagnosing patients from hypertension treatment with my ABPM&lt;/a&gt;) I may have some availability in my practice without affecting my &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/continuity-report/&quot;&gt;continuity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means I can potentially increase my panel size a bit and still provide similar care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just done a little free within-my-practice advertising and wanted to share what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mailchimp&quot;&gt;Mailchimp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;Don’t do email lists yourself&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a &lt;em&gt;solved problem&lt;/em&gt; that can be done much better than doing it yourself. I love Mailchimp. The free plan is way more than I need. If you ever need to do this on a larger practice basis (more frequent, more providers), it would scale just fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I don’t imagine anyone will ever use this ‘Spreading Monkey Love’ and I don’t really need credits since I use the free account. But here’s my referral code.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://eepurl.com/k0gpf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/04/MC_MonkeyReward_05.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With MailChimp you get tools that allow you to automatically do things right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Include unsubscribe and other bits that make this not spam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic removal of bounced emails from the list.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;free templates (Pick the stethoscope one. Bang, you’re done.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awesome analytics&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-a-lil-panel-campaign-look-like&quot;&gt;What does a lil panel campaign look like?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My clinic started collected addresses more seriously about 18 months ago (when we started Portal to get ready for Meaningful Use.) That’s a relatively recent/fresh list of emails. Call it about 1/3 of my panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a crystal report to generate a list of ~650 patients. After importing to MailChimp, this was cleaned up to 637.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;637 Sent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;62 bounced messages (auto-removed from the list)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;306 Opened&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;201 Opened within first 8 hours, sent at noon. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;269 Unopened after a couple weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 patient sent me a custom card with the picture of me/Becca&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;0 Unsubscribes&lt;/em&gt; (after a specific call to action to unsubscribe!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 People Verbally asked me about it in 2 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 New patients have established in the last 2 weeks (and each one mentioned the email when asked.) And I know of 2 more patients who will be establishing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the first 2 days of opens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-16-at-10.23.09-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-campaign-design&quot;&gt;My Campaign Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted this email to be personal (vs. corporate) so I included a picture of me with one of my daughters. I aimed the ‘voice’ as being from me, not my clinic. I also wrote the text for simplicity (&lt;a href=&quot;/?s=readability&quot;&gt;low reading level is a theme on unchart&lt;/a&gt;….)  It looks partly like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-16-at-10.27.46-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howdy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone recommends me to a family member or friend, it’s one of my biggest compliments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My practice has been closed for a few years. I want to be available when you need me. I’ve been accepting family members but sometimes it gets confusing when you talk to my receptionists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m opening my practice again temporarily. If you know someone who needs a family physician, would you recommend they make an appointment with me. Give us a call at (360) 428-1700.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I hate spam as much as anyone! If you feel it’s inappropriate for me to email, click the unsubscribe link in the message. I’ll be tracking
that….)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Jonathan Ploudre, MD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One mistake&lt;/strong&gt;: Open/Closed is jargon. My manager caught that but I had sent it before I got a second pair of eyes. It’s confused some people but I guess I’m thinking all publicity is good publicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another mistake&lt;/strong&gt;: This needed to be more carefully proofed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third mistake&lt;/strong&gt;: I might have considered making this ‘likable’ for facebook. If 2% on the list had liked this on facebook, it may have doubled the exposure. I don’t need to get the word out super-fast but it would have been easy to do and probably would have increased the number of new patients. Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said: In 2 weeks, I’ve added 5 patients who were personally recommended to me by people I know. These have been fun because each person is also an embedded compliment from a patient. And having a connection is great for getting to know people. My guess is that this will end up with 10 new patients (people will forget this pretty quickly.) Not bad for a few minutes of work and no money spent. And it’s building community.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;before-my-first-webex-james-foster-of-e-mds-advised-me-paraphrased&quot;&gt;Before my first webex, James Foster of e-MDs advised me (paraphrased):&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mute participants to avoid horrible distraction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have the technical support number handy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Embed some music at the start so people don’t say, “I don’t hear anything, has the webinar started?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start the webinar 30 minutes prior and load the slide deck up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t actually start till 2-3 minutes after the real start because people always run late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;then-i-decided-based-on-limited-experience&quot;&gt;Then I decided based on limited experience:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Separate the video and audio. Using a telephone (ideally
a speakerphone) will probably be more reliable than doing VOIP.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re using a cell – make sure you’ve got 2+ hours of talktime battery.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you’ve got a quiet place with good internet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aggressively ‘mute’ people to keep the audio clean for the recording.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;afterwards-running-my-first-webex-i-also-learned&quot;&gt;Afterwards running my first webex, I also learned:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VOIP sound quality is better than over the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I say ‘um’ a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I’m multitasking, my talking takes a massive quality hit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Busy-ness: People don’t necessarily prepare, even when you tell them to prepare.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The more I edit myself out of the podcast, the better the quality gets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many people can mute/unmute themselves. Trust people more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Storytelling is awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussion is awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow more Q&amp;amp;A.;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trust the timeflow more – don’t overcontrol.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Group Visit Invitation</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/group-visit-invitation/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be doing a diabetic group visit – a dinner club.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would I offer to give free food as part of a doctor visit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By going over dinnertime, I can make it easier for diabetics with a job to stay on top of diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exemplify some healthy meals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time savings of group visits over individual visits give me more practice flexibility (open up appointment slots)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Longer-time of group visit allows much more learning than routine visits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have about 80 diabetics in my practice. I’m hoping to get about half to join a dinner club for a year. Good food, good conversation and good diabetic care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-invitation-text&quot;&gt;My invitation (text)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting a &lt;strong&gt;diabetes ‘dinner club’&lt;/strong&gt; that will meet every 3 months for a year.  This will be a group visit where you’ll get your labs done, related refills and a chance for one-on-one time with me. Like other doctor visits, if you have a co-pay, you’ll still have to do that. (Sorry, I don’t control the healthcare system!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, unlike a regular doctor visit, &lt;strong&gt;I’ll be providing dinner&lt;/strong&gt; and we’ll have time as a group to eat  and discuss diabetes &amp;amp; how to care for it. We’ll make something tasty (and appropriate for diabetes!) to eat. I’m doing this at dinnertime so that if you have a job you don’t have to take much/any time off to come to this longer visit.
I did group visits a few years ago and people really seemed to enjoy them. Sometimes it’s easier to learn from someone else’s questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 5:00 - 7:00 pm 
&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; Tuesday, 4/3/2012
&lt;strong&gt;Where:&lt;/strong&gt; At the Office
&lt;strong&gt;RSVP:&lt;/strong&gt; Call and leave a message with my nurse Heather. 428-1700
I’m going to limit this to 8 people so call now to reserve a spot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you can come!
Dr. Jonathan Ploudre&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Medicare e-Rx Report</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/medicare-e-rx-report/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-10T09:56:53-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/medicare-e-rx-report</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Medicare e-Rx code drove my practice crazy last year. We e-prescribe all the time and many of us successfully attested for Meaningful Use. But the e-prescribing rule doesn’t allow for tracking that way. Instead it requires &lt;em&gt;a bonus g-code&lt;/em&gt; be submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, Medicare, stop the madness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara Evans rightly recognized this as a reporting problem. My clinic did not. So near the end of the year, we had to post orange signs to remind all the docs at our clinic to remember to do the extra click on Medicare patients if we did an electronic prescription. This &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/deskilling/&quot;&gt;deskills&lt;/a&gt; us and distracts us from doctoring. In our case where we can prove we e-prescribe, there’s literally no benefit to offset deskilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara’s report allows the code to be added by the biller when posting to medicare. Fewer people doing the code makes it less error prone than what my clinic did last year. I took her report (a more complete listing of all prescriptions, method of sending, etc) and simplified it. I think my changes work (it results the same as when I hard-coded our doctors into Sara’s report.) &lt;strong&gt;But you need to validate that this report is accurate for your practice.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reports people seen in the last 5 days, who have Medicare, and who had an e-prescription done in the past 5 days. In our practice docs don’t do e-prescribing outside of visits (Nurses handle refills) so for us, this is a valid shortcut for e-prescription with a visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/03/Medicare-Prescription-Check.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Medicare Prescription Check&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, Sara has managed her husband’s practice, Evans Dermatology Partners.  Prior to that, she was a management consultant with McKinsey &amp;amp; Co. in Dallas and London.  At McKinsey, her work focused on streamlining clients’ retail store operations.  Her undergraduate degree is in Russian from Wesleyan University and she has an MBA from Duke University.  She and her husband Colby live in Austin, TX and have three children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It generates a nice flat file list of appointments that you can select by date. Includes check in time, date, check out time, and optionally who did the check in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love ‘flat file’ reports like this – it allows you to do your own analysis in an easier tool like Excel (See my &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/data-driven-practice/&quot;&gt;Data-Driven Practice&lt;/a&gt; page) With just a few extra columns and a pivot table, I could answer questions like: Are Monday Appointments longer? Do my receptionists share check-in equally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted this for several years – I think it’ll improve flow, reduce disparities in vitals and reduce transcription errors on vitals. If we implement this right, we can even use it to improve the human-ness of our rooming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; I had to put my name on top as we are only a one provider

 Please note: CONSULTANT  is the REFERRING

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This report is a doozy. It solves a quality issue: keeping the PCP in the loop. As a family doctor, I can tell you which practices have a foolproof system for sending me letters and which ones I have to nag and waste time repeatedly requesting records when I referred them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a consultant and don’t have a system for insuring that records are repeatedly sent, &lt;strong&gt;get started&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do have a process: Could this automate it for you. I consider a fab report to be one that solves a real problem and gets run and used regularly. For consultants, this is fab. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a coversheet and then the notes (only those marked as NEWP or CONS). Obviously this needs to be modified per clinic but it’s a template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The future is already here – it’s just not very evenly distributed.”&lt;br /&gt;
 —William Gibson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-basics&quot;&gt;The Basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What:&lt;/strong&gt; Practice Improvement Webinar hosted by UnChart for e-MDs users.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;How:&lt;/strong&gt; Roundtable discussion of participants about attempts at practice improvement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When:&lt;/strong&gt; Friday, March 23, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When:&lt;/strong&gt; 10am -12pm  Pacific; 11am - 1pm Mountain; 12pm - 2pm Central; 1pm - 3pm Eastern.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Where:&lt;/strong&gt; A quiet place for you to Webex (via Computer, iPad, iPhone, Android.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Commitments:&lt;/strong&gt; 1) A $20 Coordination Fee per location. Feel free to bring partners to your webex. 2) A story of change – an improvement or a failed change. And what you learned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Limits:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a smallish roundtable. ~ 20 participants.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in connecting with other innovative docs. I want to hear stories of improvements that worked. I want to hear stories about changes that flopped. I want to distill the expertise of other docs that are working on the same problems I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 4 years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa0802005#t=article&quot;&gt;Only 4% of ambulatory practices had a complete EHR&lt;/a&gt; like e-MDs. Generally, docs using e-MDs are way ahead of the curve. It’s time we collaborate more with our colleagues. Let’s learn from docs that are working on their second year of Meaningful Use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e-MDs hosts a ‘User Conference’. It’s aimed at basic and intermediate users. At UnChart, I’m thinking I’d like to go to a &lt;em&gt;Clinical Innovation Summit&lt;/em&gt;. Since I couldn’t find the conference I wanted to attend, &lt;strong&gt;I’ve decided to host it myself&lt;/strong&gt;. But ‘innovation’ has baggage because people wrongly think I mean tech or macros or crystal reports.  So I want to focus on Practice Improvement as part of innovation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion-not-lecture&quot;&gt;Discussion, not lecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously: &lt;strong&gt;Do Not Sign Up&lt;/strong&gt; if you’re not willing to share. I’m hoping to create a lively discussion. No freeloaders. Don’t expect that we’ll run out of time before your turn….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; Registration Closed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;topics&quot;&gt;Topics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my unsorted/starter list of topics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ll talk about our purple sheet, planning preventive visits and why it took us 5 tries to fix a simple problem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jeff G.’s interested in iPrism, a device to control/monitor staff usage of the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jenny P: Topic Pending&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christine H: Topic Pending&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chris S: e-MDs Employee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Terry F: e-MDs Employee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sara E: Using Reports to improve practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chris O: Lessons with Dragon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;….. More to come.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Health Information Exchanges</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/health-information-exchanges/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-07T17:01:04-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/health-information-exchanges</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ll be helping min-ns.org to set up our local HIE. As part of that, I’ve been focusing on the message for doctors about Health Information Exchanges (and Meaningful Use and EHRs). I’m especially proud of my video about what a HIE is – I humbly submit this is the best video on the Internet about that topic. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-connect&quot;&gt;Why Connect?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIN-NS: Medical Information Network-North Sound&lt;br /&gt;
HIE: Health Information Exchange  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIN-NS helps doctors unify our medical community for better care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-control-of-your-patients-care-team&quot;&gt;Take Control of your Patient’s Care Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients think we are always know what’s going on at other doctors offices or at the hospital. They tell us “I told them to send your the records.” It’s not that simple. There are processes and hurdles – like HIPAA. A doctor can’t just email a colleague. It has to be secure end-to-end. With MIN-NS, a single secure network can connect our whole medical community. Secure email with hospitalists or consultants or referral docs. MIN-NS will aggregate data from different doctors so we can all stay in the loop for a complicated patient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expand-our-reach&quot;&gt;Expand Our Reach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to have conversations with our colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It costs less because it allows direct connections without staff/medical records overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Up to date lab results from other doctors’ practices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get access to ER records without having to call and wait for a fax. (And hope it arrives while the patient is still here.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simplify HIPAA/Privacy concerns by having a &lt;strong&gt;single legal agreement&lt;/strong&gt; to connect our local medical community together. That includes SVH, UGH, and Island Hospital. That includes private practices. Having a single agreement means we don’t have to drown in paperwork to innovate and improve our care.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be ready to provide informed care the first time a new patient walks into your urgent care.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatically get a discharge summary – no matter which of the local hospitals your patient went to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve all got personal priorities. Customize and filter the views of your patient’s data to fit what you need most.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Achieve &lt;em&gt;Meaningful Use&lt;/em&gt; by satisfying the core requirement to exchange &lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt; clinical data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-a-hie&quot;&gt;What’s a HIE?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides unifying our medical community, a Health Information Exchange (HIE) is an electronic network for securely sharing patient information. It includes secure addition, maintenance, storage and delivery of health records. It focuses on uniquely identifying patients. Obviously it has security regulations like HIPAA and HITECH baked in. Unlike an individual electronic health records system (EHR) of, say, a private doctor, the HIE aggregates information across different systems and EHRs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HIE creates a comprehensive record that all of the subscribing healthcare providers can use. Subscribers can access records of individual lab results, consulting reports, and summaries of care. Subscribers can also have the system consolidate the records into a summary that includes information from all the various EHRs and various doctors involved in the patient’s care. The Documents can be viewed online, printed, downloaded, or imported straight into an EHR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIN-NS health information exchange is bringing together hospitals, physicians and other medical service providers. It’s a first step that will later connect us to doctors across Washington State and eventually across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-now&quot;&gt;Why Now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meaningful Use&lt;/em&gt; is the kickstarter for creating a HIE. In the 2009 Recovery Act, the government created a stimulus to encourage doctors and hospitals to start using electronic health records (EHRs). In particular, the CMS and Medicaid programs are encouraging “Meaningful Use” of EHRs to improve care, engage patients in their care, and improve care coordination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 15 required items to show Meaningful Use – one of which is the ability to interchange key clinical data (like via MIN-NS). Meaningful Use is real: local docs have already received checks for $18,000 for doing Stage 1 Meaningful Use in 2011. Over the next few years, proactive docs could receive a total of $44,000 from Medicare or $63,750 from Medicaid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;procrastinating-is-going-to-hurt&quot;&gt;Procrastinating is going to hurt.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t think the stimulus matters, be careful. There’s a carrot/stick going on with Meaningful Use. In a few years, CMS and Medicaid will start penalizing providers who can’t show Meaningful Use. And as years go by, the penalities will get bigger and bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-does-it-all-work&quot;&gt;How does it all work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaningful Use provides benchmarks for measuring a modern EHR.  Modern EHRs capture structured data about care so that we can use it to improve care, reduce health care disparities and exchange information. The MIN-NS HIE coupled with a certified EHR will meet all stage one criteria as defined in
the final rule published by CMS. Secure sharing is central to Meaningful use. By having data distribution and integration, we can avoid difficult and expensive point-to-point intregrations. As Meaningful Use evolves into Stage 2 in 2014 and Stage 3 afterwards, MIN-NS will provide additional functionality to keep our HIE compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Interfacing Devices to e-MDs</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/interfacing-devices-to-e-mds/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-13T13:29:04-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/interfacing-devices-to-e-mds</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;John Crankshaw mentioned a process for interfacing devices to e-MDs (without having to buy the more expensive models that are supported.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/01/ZanimageDocmanBatchscreenshots.docx.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Printable Word Document&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take it away Dr. Crankshaw….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-the-docman-batch-import-utility-as-an-interface&quot;&gt;Using the Docman Batch Import Utility as an Interface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our office uses the Docman Batch Import Utility along with a tiff converter, zan image printer, to upload into e-mds many different documents.   We auto import results directly into a patient’s chart from our Midmark EKG, Holter, PFT computer.  We also auto import directly into a patient chart lab results from our Labdaq system from our in house Lab.  I also use it to import documents from the Hospital online Portal and our state immunization registry.  These documents appear in e-mds as tiff documents just like any other scanned document.  The following is an example of how we have set up our system to auto import documents from the Midmark computer.
Since the Midmark system allows us to add the e-mds ID to the demographics, we are then capable of importing the results directly into the patients chart.  The zan image printer, during tiff conversion, is able to scan the document for the e-mds ID and include it in the file name, which then allows the Docman Batch Import Utility to import the document directly into the patient’s chart and notify a user the results are ready.&lt;br /&gt;
The first step is setting up the Docman Batch Import Utility if you haven’t set it up yet.  It should be installed on just one computer.  The utility is on the latest e-mds solution series disc if you haven’t installed it.  When you install from the e-mds disc, click custom and check it off.   I would recommend looking at the instructions for the Docman Batch Import Utility on the last disc you have from e-mds or download the instructions from the e-mds support center.  It will walk you through the installation steps.   The Docman Utility gets installed as a service on your computer.  The utility needs to have constant access to the shared folders it is monitoring.  If the shared folders are on a different computer and that computer is turned off, then the utility will not work when that other computer is restarted.   The service will need to be restarted.    I recommend that the computers that have the shared folders be constantly on.   Here is a screenshot of the Docman Utility Service:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/01/docman-utility.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/docman-utility-300x224.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing the Docman Utility, you will need to set up shared folders on the computer you will be downloading results.    The following are screenshots from our Midmark computer of the folder setup: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/01/midmark-import.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/midmark-import-150x150.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/01/midmark2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/midmark2-150x150.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you will have to change the settings in the Docman Utility.  The following are my settings for the Midmark import:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Default Docman Category…:  Cardiovascular (you choose which ever you like though)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parsing Options:  Second for Patient Account Number, Third for Document Description, and the rest I left Not present.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delimiter _ (underscore)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File Extension * (asterisks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time to wait - 90 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Auto Tasking -  Check Send Taskman message -  then choose who you want to receive the message when imported and who should get a message if it didn’t work right.   (exception).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/01/docman-settings.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/docman-settings-150x150.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is installing and setting up the Zan Image Printer on the computer you will download the information to.  For us, we installed it on the same computer that has the Midmark software.  The Zan Image Printer is third party software that has a nominal cost. http://www.zan1011.com/ 
 (Disclosure: I have no relation financially with the makers of Zan Image printer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I install it, I install a color version and bw (black and white version).  The black and white version is what I use.  The zan image printer installs just like any other printer.  Go to the Printers and Faxes for window XP or Devices and Printers for Win7.   Right click and click printing preferences.
I’ll go through each tab in the printing preferences with screen shots for each. (See the download for all the images.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Layout - No changes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;￼Paper/Quality - Paper Source - Automatically Select;   Color - Black &amp;amp; White	￼&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save – Folder - click browse and browse to the shared folder you created;  File Name:  Click Macro and pick at the bottom Regex Document Name.  Then make sure the File Name looks like this:   Document_[%RegexDocName]_EKG-Holter-Spirometry   (the EKG-Holter-Spirometry part you can change to any name you want.  This is what the documents name will be in docman when imported) When File exists: Show warning dialog. Before Printing… - No Dialogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/01/ZanimageDocmanBatchscreenshots.docx&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Download the printable Word Document with all the screenshots&lt;/a&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

   <title>Coumadin in e-MDs</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/coumadin-in-e-mds/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-13T08:17:29-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/coumadin-in-e-mds</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s been a discusssion on &lt;a href=&quot;http://supportcenter.e-mds.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=3222&amp;forumContentID;=109653&quot;&gt;SupportCenter&lt;/a&gt; about Coumadin Plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mal Riddell has offered his template:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/01/Coumadin__Plan__MR.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Coumadin Plan Template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mal’s process: We use a shortcut for our INR/PT patients that includes a  99211 charge for the most part.  If I see them significantly, I delete the charge and add the appropriate charge after the visit.    The template is a generic plan template and allows for changes in dose.  The nurse loads the previous template in the current note (via the Shortcut) and adds the INR value.  If it is within range, there is no change and the patient returns the following month.  If needed, I can see the patient and make changes to the dose.  I use a base of 5 mg tabs and alter the dose by ½ tab increments, based upon a weekly total dose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coumadin-algorithm&quot;&gt;Coumadin Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I do a coumadin algorithm process. In e-MDs, this lives as a pretty basic flowsheet. The rest of the process (remembering who is due, patient instructions, management decisions) are embedded in a set of paper documents below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coumadin Documents based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aafp.org/fpm/2005/0500/p77.html&quot;&gt;AAFP&lt;/a&gt; and Group Health Cooperative. These are my ‘Coumadin Algorithm’. Studies have shown that algorithmic coumadin management outperforms usual care – more time in therapeutic range and less complications. So I focus on the judgement issues (should you start? should you bridge for a procedure) and my nurse manages the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group Health uses a protocol driven approach. With that approach they have been able to reduce event rates in warfarin patients from 9.25% to 5.09% (as of 2007).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group Health uses a custom relational database program called Dawn-AC to manage the anticoagulation for patients in western Washington. They use a systems approach to monitoring who needs testing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GH also has a protocol for initiating coumadin and bridging anticoagulation around procedures (in addition to monitoring). The scope of the protocol is broader than the AAFP published protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other benefit I’ve noticed is that having my nurse doing coumadin managment is a source of job satisfaction for her (she gets to do some real nursing) and the process is much quicker for patients than ‘routine management by a doctor.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This appears to be fixed as of today.  Interestingly enough the new formatting doesn’t redesign the site but it makes exactly the change that I mention below. This makes it much more usable for patients.&lt;/em&gt; – Jonathan Ploudre, 1/25/2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portal has a usability bug that affects a lot of patients (anyone using Google Chrome, Safari, iPhone, iPad, Android Phones, RIM Phones, Kindle Fires, etc.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read about the &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/portal-layout-bug/&quot;&gt;Portal Usability Bug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;edit-your-profile-to-add-the-signature&quot;&gt;Edit your profile to add the signature.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-08-at-12.50.35-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/edit-profile.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/edit-signature.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;then-you-could-paste-in-this-signature&quot;&gt;Then you could paste in this signature:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; ---
 Post this to your signature if Patient Usability Matters on Portal.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;then-add-signatures-when-you-post-to-supportcenter&quot;&gt;Then add signatures when you post to SupportCenter.&lt;/h3&gt;

   <title>Portal Layout Bug</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-25-at-7.46.18-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This appears to be fixed as of today.  Interestingly enough the new formatting doesn’t redesign the site but it makes exactly the change that I mention below. This makes it much more usable for patients.&lt;/em&gt; – Jonathan Ploudre, 1/25/2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/01/portalscreenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/portalscreenshot-300x190.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-portal-look-like-that&quot;&gt;Why does portal look like that?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do some ancient history. More than 10 years ago, &lt;em&gt;Internet Explorer 5.0&lt;/em&gt; (yes, 5.0) had a bug in how it rendered layout. This is called the IE Box Model Bug. It was fixed in IE 6.0. But for backwards compatibility IE usually replicates the buggy behavior of IE 5. (So do newer version of IE, this is called ‘Quirks mode’) Firefox on Windows decided to replicate the bug for compatibility with IE, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When portal was written, I assume they didn’t even test it on other browsers besides IE. It would have been easy to fix (see below) but they weren’t looking for it. To be fair, 10 years ago a lot of developers did that. And I don’t know exactly when portal was developed but it was a while ago and doesn’t seem to have active development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the last 10 years, more and more browsers are not IE/Firefox on Windows. There are more Macs now. Google Chrome is a popular Browser. iPhone, iPad, and Android Phones. The new Kindle Fire. They all do standards-based layout so the Portal Layout Bug shows up on lots of devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago when I was pointing out the bug to Tech Support, their advice was that I &lt;em&gt;tell all my patients to use IE on Windows&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;del&gt;Um, Seriously?&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lest it sound like I’m a biased Mac user (which, I am), &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_box_model_bug&quot;&gt;Read about the IE Box Model Bug on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/01/portalscreenshotmarked.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/portalscreenshotmarked-300x190.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to fix this. On the example above where the
Inbox flows wrong, this is the code that’s broken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#ContentLeft {
   float: left;
   width: 20%;
   padding: 20px 0px 20px 20px;
}
#ContentRight {
   float: left;
   width: 79.5%;
   padding: 20px 20px 20px 30px;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this renders in a modern browser (with padding added on) it adds
up to more than &lt;strong&gt;20% + 79.5% + Padding &amp;gt; 100%&lt;/strong&gt; and so it overflows down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quick hack (that then renders in all browsers correctly) would be
to switch to something like width: &lt;strong&gt;70%&lt;/strong&gt; on #ContentRight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several box model bugs on the page (look at the sidebar
boxes) so to fix everything a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200612/internet_explorer_and_the_css_box_model/&quot;&gt;developer would probably want to
reorganize the css&lt;/a&gt; rather than just hack the number like I mention above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without doing a complete portal design, a web developer could fix all the Portal Layout Bugs in a couple hours. I’d fix it myself, but I don’t have access to the templates for portal. And I’m sure e-MDs isn’t going to ask me. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Keep Reading: &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/encourage-e-mds-to-fix-portal-usability/&quot;&gt;Let’s Encourage e-MDs to Fix Usability for Patients on Portal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>e-MDs Portal Auto-Messages</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/e-mds-portal-auto-messages/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-07T22:10:45-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/e-mds-portal-auto-messages</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the setup tasks for portal is to create some standard messages – disclaimers, warnings, and the like.  I had forgotten that it  was one of the things I ‘ran through my readability program’ I’ve been re-writing clinic paperwork for a while. My all time fav: &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/hipaa-form/&quot;&gt;the HIPAA form&lt;/a&gt; – unrecognizable compared to the previous version. I also have a &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/patient-portal-form/&quot;&gt;Patient Portal Signup Form&lt;/a&gt;. Until a couple months ago my office manager thought that I had an app that did simplification. Nope, I just edit/re-edit/reword until it’s shorter, simpler and clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we came up for portal auto-messages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appointment-acknowledgement-message&quot;&gt;Appointment Acknowledgement Message&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for scheduling an appointment. We’ve got it and look forward to seeing you.  If you have any refill or referral requests, you might want to discuss that at your visit (rather than use the portal before the visit..) It’s a good idea review your medical history before you come in – you might be able to spot something to discuss or correct before we see you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appointment-disclaimer-message&quot;&gt;Appointment Disclaimer Message&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re trying to make scheduling convenient for you! If you’re not sure about whether you’ve scheduled things right, you might want to call a receptionist during business hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;email-notification-subject&quot;&gt;Email Notification Subject&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve sent you a message. Please check your patient portal account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;email-notification-message&quot;&gt;Email Notification Message&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve got a new message in your secure mail box on our portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can log on to the portal from our website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://ncfp.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And click on the login button. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, and we’ll be in touch,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Cascade Family Physicians
360-428-1700&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disclaimer-message&quot;&gt;Disclaimer Message&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access the portal day or night, but we don’t have a 24 hour presence on our end. If there’s an emergency, you should go to Urgent Care, the Emergency Room or call 911. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warning-message&quot;&gt;Warning Message&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bedside manner is complicated via email. It’s easy to misread information or emotion. We’ll try to keep things brief and clear on the Portal. We really appreciate your help on that, too. If a message takes a long time to write, it’s probably better done in person.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Usability of the Washington State Prescription Monitoring Program </title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2012/usability-of-the-washington-state-prescription-monitoring-program/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-05T01:44:17-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2012/usability-of-the-washington-state-prescription-monitoring-program</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The idea of the prescription monitoring program (PMP) &lt;strong&gt;rocks&lt;/strong&gt;. Given that multiple controlled substances are potentially lethal, a prescriber or pharmacist should be able to verify other prescriptions. Transparency improves care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s implemented with unnecessary friction. This is going to reduce how many busy docs or pharmacists are willing to go through the hassle. The more complicated and time-consuming it is, the less it’s worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-set-up-with-the-pmp&quot;&gt;Getting set up with the PMP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup on a computer might only take a few minutes so I don’t want to be overly critical. Still, the virtual multi-factor security is ‘Security Theater’. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication&quot;&gt;Real Multifactor Security&lt;/a&gt; is real. Combine a Username/Password with retinal scanner and you’ve got a little bit of a roadblock. (In the movies, it’s sometimes gross if they bypass the retinal scanner.) Or: having a physical dongle with password.  But this isn’t real multifactor security – it’s just a more extended password setup with cookies and a bookmark. The obvious flaw: if my email account were compromised, anyone could set up another virtual token – no hacking or eyeball removal required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion: Drop the virtual 2 factor security altogether. It doesn’t really improve security. All behavior on the site is being logged. They plan to audit for aberrant searching behavior. If they follow through on that, it’s enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usability-issue-repeated-usageprivacy-warnings&quot;&gt;Usability Issue: Repeated Usage/Privacy Warnings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you get a warning box every time you do a search, do you really read it? You might the first time, right? I could see where there should be a usage and privacy policy. Curent design is to have it interrupt you every time you log in. It’s not much of a welcome:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-04-at-11.43.40-PM-300x236.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt that 5% of users will actually read it after the first time. (Taunt for PMP Designers: Use your server logs/analytics to disprove me.) This looks like it was designed by a lawyer with no consideration for whether it would do anything but slow providers/pharmacists down. Um, it might have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readability matters. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ted.com/2010/03/24/lets_simplify_l/&quot;&gt;Alan Siegel’s 5 minute Ted talk&lt;/a&gt; is the most damning critique of this type of information pollution. So, let’s run an analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gunning-Fog (approximate year of formal education needed): 17&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Word Count: 277&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average Words per sentence: 23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s about a minute of highly concentrated attention to truly read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my version is essentially identical&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;practitionerpharmacist-statement&quot;&gt;Practitioner/Pharmacist Statement&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I’m licensed prescriber (or designee) or dispenser.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I’ll use this only for medical/pharmaceutical care.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Before I give a patient a copy, I’ll be sure of identity.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I realize other searching/revealing of private information is illegal and could result in disciplinary action or lawsuit. This info should be protected like other Protected Health Info (PHI). &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I’ll safeguard my password. If there are issues with safeguarding, I’ll let the Department of Health know immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I’m being watched/audited.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I agree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a quick rewrite but:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gunning-Fog from 17 to 12&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Word Count: 277 to 79&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average Words per sentence: 23 to 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion: Drop the required click through. And if you dramatically simplify like I’m showing above, you might actually encourage real people read it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usability-issue-make-search-form-easier&quot;&gt;Usability Issue: Make Search Form Easier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you move your eyes through the search form, you have a jumble of needing to carefully check everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-05-at-1.00.10-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-05-at-1.00.10-AM-300x247.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the available options, seem to be missing the whole point of a &lt;strong&gt;statewide prescription monitoring program&lt;/strong&gt;. Why give an option to search by county? That’s close to never useful. If location really mattered they would do ‘within 10/25/50/100 miles’. (The DEA knows my address already without me typing it in.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like this would be better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/PMP-Search-Revised.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly you could simplify to just Patient Name/DOB (since Dispense dates appear to autofill, anyhow). Just give advanced options for all those providers who only care about your zip code or county. (Why would they want to know if you go across town? Oh, wait, that’s the whole point.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-05-at-1.24.52-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-issue-design-from-1998&quot;&gt;Bonus Issue: Design from 1998&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I get crotchety. The use of tables for layout and embedded font and color formatting is something that hasn’t been best practice since, um, the 1990s. There’s a reason that this site has a Netscape Navigator 4 vibe: the underlying code is designed as if we’re partying like it’s 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I sound like a snob. But practice as a doctor is filled with unending demands for attention. Reducing friction with a modern/simpler design means I’m much more likely to use this. It’s not about making it ‘shiny’. It’s about improving care. Usability really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cleaner SQL Backups -- Automatic Log Out</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/cleaner-sql-backups-automatic-log-out/"/>
   <updated>2011-12-16T08:54:53-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/cleaner-sql-backups-automatic-log-out</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t always log out and shutdown my computer every day. Partly because things change and sometimes I’m gone. I don’t shutdown because I often log onto my machine from home (so it needs to be powered on). I don’t plan learning to logout. It’s nice to come back to the machine (via RDP) with everything open, right where I left it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having an open e-MDs client during backup, though, is a ‘bad idea’. As in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hulu.com/watch/10310/saturday-night-live-bad-idea-jeans&quot;&gt;Bad Idea Jeans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a small freeware program to fix this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/29-heart.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dimio.altervista.org/eng/&quot;&gt;DShutdown by Dimio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mine set up like this (click on the screenshot to see it full size):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/12/screenshot.4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/12/screenshot.4-281x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down in the bottom left, I set up the timer like this. So everyday at 11pm it force logs out of my machine. When this app is on, you can see it’s icon down in the system tray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/12/screenshot.3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/12/screenshot.3-235x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Quick Feedback with Google Forms</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/quick-feedback-with-google-forms/"/>
   <updated>2011-12-14T07:49:12-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/quick-feedback-with-google-forms</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fred Wilson, a Venture Capitalist, has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/11/continuous-feedback.html&quot;&gt;great blog post about continuous feedback&lt;/a&gt;. At a small startup they ask: What’s three things we’re doing well at? What’s three things we need to do better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting that type of feedback on a regular basis allows you to spot issues quickly. Or exploit strengths to do really brilliant work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of us don’t have a good way to do this quickly. Enter Google Forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;google-forms-your-feedback-collecting-robot&quot;&gt;Google Forms: Your Feedback Collecting Robot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You create a simple form that you can then e-mail. The results get auto-entered into a spreadsheet so you can analyze without spending any grunt-work time. By lowering the friction of feedback, Google Forms can really rock work processes. Have all the nurses heard about the new policy? Does anyone have any issues with it? Couple minutes in Google Forms and you’ll collect &lt;em&gt;anonymous&lt;/em&gt; results. This works fine for subjective data (don’t have 30 results in your inbox for you process manually!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know if my recent lecture to MS3s was on target so I did a 2 question form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-14-at-7.38.02-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-14-at-7.38.02-AM-300x290.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to use this pervasively to confirm that changes in our clinic have really gone through and that we know what the issues are.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, too many clicks. Macros are one of my loves the last few years. Reduce a single thought into a single physical action. It’s not that I can’t click 5 times to do one thing. &lt;em&gt;Actually, I’m pretty good at clicking&lt;/em&gt;. As I’ve mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/deskilling/&quot;&gt;article about becoming my patient’s data entry technician&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve got limited attention bandwidth. Clicking requires too much focus. I practice EHR all the time; I should be able to play it like a piano. I need a single thought to be a single frictionless action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;macros-lubricate-your-life-as-a-doctor&quot;&gt;Macros lubricate your life as a doctor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be great if it could just &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;___ with one click?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’ve talked to docs about this, they tend to &lt;strong&gt;aim way to high&lt;/strong&gt;. They start thinking about clinical scenarios that are brain intensive. I think that’s the wrong place to start. Start with the mundane stuff.  Don’t start programming Autohotkey! I know I’ve mentioned it a bazillion times, but it’s not the place to start. Especially if you’re still learning your workflows. It’s a waste of time to automate workflows you are going to discard. Don’t automate a clinical task you do once a week. Get boring things like opening attachments (which I do dozens of times daily.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First:&lt;/strong&gt; Download &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/e-mds-macros/&quot;&gt;my macros&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These turn common/boring actions in taskman, order tracking, etc into keystrokes you can do without looking at the screen. I think you’ll have ROI of 1-2 weeks for your time. Not to mention this fixes about 5000 typos you might make. &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/e-mds-macros/&quot;&gt;My e-MDs macros&lt;/a&gt; definitely lubricate your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are going to learn autohothey, at the beginning learn just one thing: hotstrings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hotstrings, I’d initially focus on ‘doctor sentences’ that you say somewhat frequently but don’t fit into your templates. These are quick to set up and save real typing. So for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; ::dflonase::Discussed usage and demonstrated how to use nasal corticosteroids.
 ::epw::Explored patient&#39;s willingness.
 ::innl::Inform patient normal results.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third:&lt;/strong&gt; Later when you’ve got your feet under you, feel free to use the source code of my macros to see how exactly I programmed them. This shows you ways to automate e-MDs and when you see how I do things it’ll give you ideas about how to make macros that are less fragile as e-MDs updates their software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last:&lt;/strong&gt; If you make a macro that’s great for you, send it my way, I’d love to have ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Journey to Meaningful Use</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/journey-to-meaningful-use/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-14T12:28:26-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/journey-to-meaningful-use</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jploudre/journey-to-meaningful-use&quot;&gt;Journey to Meaningful Use&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;View more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/&quot;&gt;presentations&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jploudre&quot;&gt;Jonathan Ploudre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-if-youre-starting-out&quot;&gt;What if you’re starting out?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my philosophical overview of how to achieve meaningful use for WIREC’s Meaningful Use Best Practices Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the thoughts that go with the slides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2008 only 1/5 ambulatory practices have an EMR and 1/25 have a ‘full’ EMR.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With Meaningful Use, there’s an set of actions that show you’re using a full EMR to an extent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This can be seen as an opportunity for innovation (my take) but it’s also a set of restrictions. It could worsen care, too. (Consider: &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/deskilling/&quot;&gt;Deskilling&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having shared benchmarks makes it much easier for clinics to innovate. Once you know how you will be measured, it’s simpler to figure out what changes you might want to do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pitfall: This isn’t at all about tech. It’s not about the Gigahertz or Hardware. It’s about how &lt;strong&gt;people do clicking&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s sociopolitical and process even though all the attention is focused on Health IT.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pitfall: Even the most independent/caring/intelligent/hardworking doctor can be inefficient. To efficiently achieve meaningful use you need a team. Reception, Nursing, Physicians, Admin all play a role. Don’t be a lone cowboy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pitfall: If you don’t carve out some breathing room away from the demands of business and patient care, you’ll struggle with doing this well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tool: Boyd’s Law. Speed of iteration beats quality of iteration. So instead of making some big/great/complicated change once a month, make 4 smaller/simpler changes. Focus on how quickly you can try things, get feedback, fix what doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tool: &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/pdsa-and-meaningful-use/&quot;&gt;Plan-Do-Study-Act Process&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in a tweet, I’d say: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make space to think as a team, make mistakes and learn from them, Repeat quickly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Closed Fracture Plan Template</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/closed-fracture-plan-template/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-12T13:02:09-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/closed-fracture-plan-template</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Angela Bashaw for sharing her orthopedic clinic’s plan template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paraphrasing her (on &lt;a href=&quot;https://supportcenter.e-mds.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=3222&amp;forumContentID;=108107&quot;&gt;SupportCenter&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;It includes &#39;closed treatment&#39; codes which are your 
&#39;fracture care&#39; codes ... options for casting and bracing 
without a closed treatment that would charge an 
application fee (ex. 29075 is application of a short arm cast). 
Also an option for when a patient destroys the cast 
and we need to replace it (we charge for that). 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Deskilling</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/deskilling/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-27T19:29:40-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/deskilling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A recent study hits too close to home:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21685794&quot;&gt;“Deskilling and adaptation among primary care physicians using two work innovations”&lt;/a&gt; says, essentially, that as primary care docs try to use innovation like EHRs and clinical guidelines, we become less trustworthy to our patients, less confident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or as I’ve put it elsewhere here: I don’t want to become my patient’s data-entry-technician. I feel like a push to gettting better visit summaries has led me to pay less attention to my patients and to rush through patient education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Via: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2011/09/unintended-consequences-standardizing-physician-practice.html&quot;&gt;KevinMD.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m considering doing a brief video about deskilling. Here’s my manifesto/script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Jonathan. I’m a doctor and a geek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13 years ago, I went to Medical School to become a generalist, a “personal physician”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 7 years, I learned about patients and diseases and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love talking to people and trying to help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a geek, I’ve been exploiting technology in doctoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s my external brain that lets me know and do things I couldn’t otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With technology, I could practice like a modern doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I heard about Meaningful Use, I knew I’d be a shoe-in because I’m geek and because I know my EHR like the back of my hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, just to be sure, I made macros to polish my usage so I could do Meaningful Clicks and still focus on the people I care for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I only have so much attention bandwidth: when I’m focusing on clicking a button I can’t be focusing on a facial expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with a respected EHR and a macro-enabled workflow, Meaningful Use is tarnishing my bedside manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare tech is de-skilling me and making me into a data-technician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ought to stop deskilling – we all need thinking doctors, not checklist completers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need tools that respect physician attention and keep doctors human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to automate and simplify necessary data capture so docs can focus on patients.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Andy Helm and Georgia HITREC for security-related info for Meaningful Use. (And Thanks to Samuel Church, MD/MPH, for hooking this up for sharing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes two major tools: a spreadsheet tool for conducting a security audit and a document with principles of security and checklists for applying them in a small practice. Good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the spreadsheet, you need to contact Andy Helm via e-mail or phone.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Opioid Treatment Agreement</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/opioid-treatment-agreement/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-16T12:11:32-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/opioid-treatment-agreement</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;treatment-agreement&quot;&gt;Treatment Agreement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am being prescribed “controlled medications”. These may relieve pain but could cause overdose or become habit forming.  It is my doctor’s duty to make sure these medications are being used as safely as possible and as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will ask for refills only from my primary doctor. I will use only one pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will take my medications only as prescribed.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will not share them or sell them to anyone. I will safeguard prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will not abuse alcohol, recreational or illegal drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My doctor may check on me by calling pharmacies or doing drug tests. My doctor may discuss my medications with my other providers. Other providers may also report violations back to my personal doctor. My doctor could even contact the authorities if illegal activities are suspected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My refills may take 3 working days and might require an office visit. I will  not request refills after hours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will not seek pain medications from the ER or Urgent Care unless there is a new, acute problem. Then I will only get a small supply until I can see my primary doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My doctor may not replace lost or stolen prescriptions. My doctor may not refill medications early if I run out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I may be dismissed from the clinic or have my medications stopped if there is a major problem. Major problems include abnormal drug test results, abusive behavior toward staff, selling medications or forging a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my rework of my current treatment agreement. This would work with the new Washington State Pain Mangement Law (See my &lt;a href=&quot;/opioid/&quot;&gt;Oploid Page &lt;/a&gt;for related bits). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stats on this treatment agreement are pretty good: Takes &lt;strong&gt;1 and 1/4 minutes to read&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;8th grade reading level.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simplifying-forms&quot;&gt;Simplifying forms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely believe in simplifying jargon. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/alan_siegel_let_s_simplify_legal_jargon.html&quot;&gt;Alan Siegel’s Ted Talk&lt;/a&gt; should be required viewing anytime anyone makes a form. (If you’ve never seen it, it’s probably the most interesting 5 minutes of video you’ll come across today.) Personally, I can’t write something and polish it’s simplicity at the same time. I reserve this type of polishing for forms that thousands of people might see.  It’s easy to forget that not all of our patients have post-graduate degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My general approach to simplifying is to use an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addedbytes.com/lab/readability-score/&quot;&gt;online readability score tool&lt;/a&gt;. I will save the initial results of the scores. &lt;em&gt;Then I iterate.&lt;/em&gt; Common iterations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut unnecessary things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eliminate duplicate ideas (or elaborating ideas).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Break long sentences into a couple shorter sentences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace longer words with shorter synonyms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to make it more like a verbal conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I make edits, every few minutes, I’ll reprocess it through the readability tool. I’m tracking to see if I can decrease word count, syllables/word, sentence length and the various readability scores. With a normal legalish clinic document, the first few minutes give the biggest improvements. Deleting sentences or paragraphs can really improve the readability. I’ll probably end up going through the document 3 or 4 times completely. Around then, I’m usually getting pretty much the same results with any tweaks and there don’t seem to be obvious improvements. So a one page form might take 30 - 45 minutes to simplify. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I did this on &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/hipaa-form/&quot;&gt;our HIPAA form&lt;/a&gt; it was transformative. This was a form that every patient was going to have to fill out. Our old form confused patients and several patients a day would still have the form coming back to the exam room because they hadn’t figured it out. Overnight the reworked for eliminated a lot of patient questions and saved everybody time on a necessary but boring task.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor Patient Handout</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitor-patient-handout/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-08T21:11:10-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitor-patient-handout</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s my info handout for patients getting Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring. It’s got some nice specifics: About 90 seconds to read, 8th Grade reading level. But it covers the key points I’ve learned with my first ~15 patients who’ve done ABPM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your doctor has recommended you get “Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring”. This is a portable cuff that will take about 100 readings over the course of 24 hours. By looking at averages and variability (both day and night) it helps us do a better job of diagnosing and treating high blood pressure. In some cases it can be used to decrease medicines or eliminate them. In others, it can make sure medicines are working like they are supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happens&quot;&gt;What happens&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We hook you up to the cuff. And turn on the machine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you switch clothes, try to change between checks. But the monitor on bare skin underneath your sleeve.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When it starts to go off, let your arm relax down by your side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes the pump will go off twice and pump extra tight – this is normal and is because of a high reading or a difficult reading for it to hear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After  24 hours, return the monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ll download the monitor and give the results to your doctor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After your doctor has had a chance to review the results the doctor/nurse will contact you with the results and plan. Sometimes this might be handled best in person and we’ll ask you to make an appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;possible-hassles&quot;&gt;Possible Hassles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some people find the cuff unbearable/too tight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can disrupt your sleep when it goes off at night. (But nighttime blood pressure is important medically so we’d really like to know what’s happening then.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It could bruise your arm or make your bicep sore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a problem with the monitor or can’t tolerate it, just take it off and return it to the clinic. We’d appreciate if you gave us a quick note of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Thanks, North Cascade Family Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>ROS and Fast Forms: A Simple Work Flow</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/ros-and-fast-forms-a-simple-work-flow/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-06T08:23:35-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/ros-and-fast-forms-a-simple-work-flow</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A guest post by Christine Hunter, PAC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/09/fastforms-hunter.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Fastforms by Christine Hunter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we started eMDs two years ago, we tried to use the Fast Forms that eMDs
had with the system. We were not very successful. We could never get a scanner that
would read the form correctly, and drop it into the note. We also had problems with the
forms themselves. It took a lot of front desk staff time to choose the form, print it, and
give it to the patient. The patients also had problems reading the small print on the forms
and couldn’t fill in the circles well enough for the scanner to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-workaround&quot;&gt;A workaround…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying to use the Fast Forms without success, I developed a work around.
We no longer print the form per patient nor do we scan them back in. In fact, we do not
use the Fast Form system at all. Instead, I made preclicks under the ROS to correspond
with each Fast Form. I typed up my own Fast Forms in Word with specific ROS
questions that correspond with the chief complaint. For example, I made individual Fast
Forms for back pain, respiratory illnesses, headache, hypertension/diabetes, etc. We
then pre-print these and have a folder at the front desk. The front desk staff can see what
the patient’s complaint is and give them the appropriate form on a clipboard to fill out
while they are waiting to be called back. The form is now in a larger font so our elderly
patients can read them. We also put the symptoms in laymen’s terms for the patients
to understand (i.e. nosebleed vs. epistaxis).The patient is told to circle any current
symptoms that are listed on the form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making my own Fast Forms per chief complaint, I then went and made
preclicks using the Review of Systems Template. For each Fast Form, I made a preclick
with all the negatives checked for each symptom on the form. I then saved these preclicks
for all users to use. We had to make preclicks for adult vs. pediatric and male vs. female.
In the end, we had to make four preclicks for each Fast Form. It took some time in the
beginning to set these preclicks up but in the end it is saving considerable amount of our
nurses’ time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when the nurse brings the patient back to the room and starts a note, she
simply determines which Fast Form the patient was given. Then chooses the appropriate
preclick with all negatives already marked. Now, all she has to do is change any
symptoms that the patient circled on the Fast Form to be positive. Now the nurses can
quickly document all the positives and pertinent negatives under the Review of Systems.
I have attached all of my Fast Forms that I have made in Word. Feel free to use
them in your practice and make corresponding preclicks in the ROS template. Then
meet with your nursing staff to make a quick workflow adjustment to have your ROS
information added to the visit note in seconds. If you have any questions regarding
my above suggestion for Review of Systems and Fast Forms, please email me at
pachunter@hotmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Unfocus: The mouseless plan</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/unfocus-the-mouseless-plan/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-01T22:23:43-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/unfocus-the-mouseless-plan</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to get a visit summary done in real-time without tradeoffs. (Sarcasm alert.) I’m awesome at tech can totally get them done. Why can’t everyone just click quickly? Seriously, though, I end up having one of these options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ignore the patient and  what they are saying while I click away&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dead Airspace while the patient waits for me to click&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave the room for a couple minutes to click without the patient right there…. except then&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ignore my nurse or get distracted by some other task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In e-MDs, the automation for filling out a template is the preclick. Call me a luddite but that level of ‘macro’ doesn’t work for plans. If you preclick a whole plan you risk integrity – documenting something you didn’t do. And there’s enough variablity of the same few things that you can’t really macro the group. Am I going to have a preclick  for ‘Call 1 week, OTC Meds, No Labs’ another for ‘Call 1 week, OTC Meds, CBC’ another for ‘Call 1 week, OTC Meds, Rx Med, No Labs’ and so on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan is &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/snappy-charting/&quot;&gt;structured data&lt;/a&gt; and ought to be done with a template instead of narrative text. Even though I might dictate the plan faster, it’s right to use the template. Using the template, for example, could let me set up a system to have my nurse check back on a patient who is trying a prescription.  We may not exploit the precision of structured plan data now but I still think templates are the right way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I need, is a way to get the plan together without needing to focus attention and click. Reminds me of a wonderful usability technique: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bumblebeelabs.com/the-5-guerrilla-user-test/&quot;&gt;The $5 Guerrilla User Test&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, the premise is that usability for distracted users can be mimicked by testing on people buzzed on alcohol. The reality of clinic is that the busyness is distracting. It’s not like I have free/unhurried time to document the plan. I’ve got a patient waiting for the visit summary, another waiting for me to start the visit, I’m personally waiting for the summary to come out of the printer and my nurse is waiting to see if she can snatch an answer to something she’s working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;unfocus-action-without-doing&quot;&gt;Unfocus: Action without Doing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my answer:  Wei wu  wei. It’s a Taoist principle. Could be interpreted as Action through inaction. Or  Creative Inaction. Or my favorit: Action without Doing. By having the computer read my mind with a few keystrokes, I can get the plan without focusing on the screen. In the video here, I’ve typed this to create my plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; F5 `c1w `med flonase `dmed `dotc `drexam
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which the computer translates to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Open first plan  
 Call in 1 week if not improving  
 New Medication (Flonase)
 Discussed medication and side effects
 Discussed OTC meds
 Discussed the reassuring exam.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/28491927&quot;&gt;UnFocus in e-MDs&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/user8098140&quot;&gt;Jonathan Ploudre&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably noticed all the ` marks. That’s my signal to the computer to listen up, I’m going to type something and I want you to read my mind. I’ve got about 170 commands covering common labs, all the options for medications or followup. They all roll off my fingers since they are mnemonics that I made. I could literally do this plan with my eyes closed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dramatically uncompresses the 20-30 most stressful minutes in a workday. It’s not much faster but it allows me to document and maintain eye contact with my patient. Or document on multiple plans without feeling overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s a foundation for errorproofing. Soon when I document a medication, it’ll automatically pop me into the the prescribing window with the med searched for and ready to select. (Eliminating double entry.) &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Visit Summary Self-Hosting</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/visit-summary-self-hosting/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-29T22:27:33-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/visit-summary-self-hosting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This is a post from 8/2011 – this article won’t stay up to date. If you are going to self-host, you need to pull original files off the server.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first got e-MDs 7.0, one of the first things I did was look at the Visit Summary. As I went to lunch a few minutes later, I brainstormed how I could bypass the formatting and create my own theme. I originally imagined putting up this set of downloadable files. Unfortunately, my plan for formatting requires a web server. And my regular server (for unchart.com) wasn’t going to work. So I figured out how to host on &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/amazon-web-services/&quot;&gt;Amazon’s Web Services&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been pretty pleased with the performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my raw files. You can host it yourself if you think you’ll have better uptime than I do. Hopefully e-MDs will make this superfluous but we’ll have to see what they do in  7.3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I organized the files on the server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; /cda.xls
 /phone.png
 /user.png
 /signpost.png
 /medical-bag.png
 /cdastyle/cda-styles/cda.xsl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I still need to host the cda.xsl at the root but I did during development. In both xsl files you’d need to change ‘50.18.44.12’ to whatever your server address is so the pictures show up. (The .png’s are hardcoded into the xsl.) You’ll probably want to change the picture at the top (ncfpleaf.png, too.) I host mine on Nginx. If these instructions are too brief for your tech guru, then you probably shouldn’t host these yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/08/Unchart-Visit-Summary-Aug2011.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Unchart Visit Summary (August 2011)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s what motivated me to share: &lt;strong&gt;Downtime&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why the server went down today (Aug, 2011). I pretty much had to accept it being down while I saw patients. &lt;strong&gt;Sorry … priorities.&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately that made my ‘uptime’ lose a  ‘9’ of reliability. Before today, I think was running at 99.9% Uptime. So far, all the previous downtime was my fault – I upgraded the format and forgot to turn on the server afterwards. I created an upgrade policy checklist so I don’t do that again. And I try not to touch the server. I’m not sure what happened today. It’ll take me 10 years to get back to 99.9% uptime. :-) After I rebooted the server, I couldn’t restart the webserver because I was at work. I had previously locked down the server to prevent hackers and I couldn’t really get to it from work (without investing time I didn’t have between patients). So good server security was the problem for quick service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, this was frustrating ~400+ times – my guess of current traffic on the server. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>e-MDs Rounds for iPhone Review</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/e-mds-rounds-for-iphone-review/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-08T00:00:31-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/e-mds-rounds-for-iphone-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/08/e-MDs-rounds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
In 1998 when I started Medical School, I was the only person in my entire school to have a PDA – a Palm Pilot. At first it seemed like a toy to my classmates. But soon it became an unfair advantage. In my pocket I had info about essentially every drug, every disease, every lab test. It was my ‘external brain’. I thought that someday every doc would have one of these. But I didn’t expect how soon it would be. In second year, my best friend got his Palm Pilot. In third year, about 30 classmates got them. Nowadays essentially every student I meet uses tech as a key part of doctoring whether it’s smartphones or websites like UpToDate. Books still exist. But my ‘odd behavior’ 13 years ago with my Palm is now totally mainstream and unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been asking about e-MDs on the iPhone for years. It’s finally here. I admit I had some trepidation when I heard that e-MDs was developing for the iPhone. Solution Series is powerful and flexible. It’s an award-winning complete package. But usability really lags. Bugs and stability issues are still a daily occurrence. There have been recent new products (OB module, I’m looking at you) that were significantly misconceived. So what will e-MDs Rounds bring? Award-winning or daily frustration?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, let’s talk about how to judge iPhone software. Mobile use is totally different than sitting down in front of a computer. Trying to shoehorn in a complete desktop experience into a small screen operated with a stubby finger is a recipe for disaster. Sure, I’ve played with e-MDs on a remote desktop app on the iPhone. But no one’s ever going to really make that work. Reducing friction makes mobile apps better. I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/2008/11/iphone_likeness&quot;&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt; nails what makes a good iPhone app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Figure out the absolute least you need 
 to do to implement the idea, do just that, 
 and then polish the hell out of the experience.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my trepidation was that e-MDs wouldn’t ‘get it’ when it comes to making great iOS software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;going-for-rounds-with-rounds&quot;&gt;Going for rounds with Rounds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start using e-MDs rounds, you have to login. Simple, right? Unfortunately not. When Rounds locks (switch away with the Home Button or Multitask), it loses whatever you were doing.  Partially typed message – gone. If you decide to look something up on UpToDate while reviewing a chart – when you log back in, you have to drill back down to the chart again. Rounds doesn’t lock at power-off so the security isn’t as tight as it could be. By enabling Quick ID, they could make login much quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e-MDs Rounds on the iPhone has four major sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schedule  (for reviewing, not adding)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patient Chart&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Messaging (read: Taskman)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refills – I couldn’t test this on the example database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schedule is an obvious fit for mobility – when do I need to be back from the hospital? How free am I next Monday? Schedule can show a day with appointment details (who, when, visit reason) or an overview of the week. Schedule is read-only – not for mobile scheduling of appointments. I think that’s an appropriate simplification. This app is aimed at mobile docs, not mobile receptionists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Schedule works, it is definitely frustrating. Every time you log in, you have to search for your schedule again. It doesn’t remember what you were looking at – it really slows down a quick lookup. There’s a time interval button that doesn’t really reformat your schedule - just changes tickmarks. If you tap on the date to change it, nothing happens. You need to go back to the schedule search. The other sections include an app navigation bar (like at the bottom of iPod App or App Store.) But when you use it to switch to schedule, it disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_886”  width=”320” caption=”Schedule doesn’t use the navigation bar on the bottom. This could be re-designed to be consistent with the rest of the App.”]&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/08/photo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-mail has long been a staple of smartphones. No wonder it’s a key part of e-MDs rounds.  None of the data is stored on your iPhone (the app is a window into your database). So e-MDs Rounds is HIPAA-compliant. &lt;strong&gt;This is big.&lt;/strong&gt; Almost certainly if you’ve been doing any patient-related work with your phone you’ve not been compliant. With more security focus in Meaningful Use and the HITECH Law you can reduce your risk of a breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Messaging is more functional than you might imagine. Attached Docman scans? View them on the phone. Attached Chart or Log Note. Ditto. I think secure mobile messaging will soon be taken for granted because it will be so obviously useful to doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_893” align=”alignnone” width=”320” caption=”You might think you tap in the space by the To: since that’s what you’d do in Mail. Instead you use the icons on the right. Tap on Subject it scrolls off the screen so you can’t see what you’re writing.”]&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/08/photo-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, messaging isn’t bug-free or speedy. Selecting a recipient involves scrolling a long list instead of using autocomplete (which you’d assume using most iPhone software.) And the buttons off to the side for selecting are not intuitive – you would assume you could type into the field where the address goes. When typing a subject, the line scrolls off screen so you can’t see what you’re typing. e-MDs Rounds allows attaching multiple documents – something I’ve not seen in Solution Series. Overall, it adds a layer to viewing/attaching attachments. It’d be quicker if only single attachments were supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these attachments show the biggest strength of e-MDs Rounds: The Patient’s Chart. All of the usual suspects are here:  Health Summary, Visit Notes, Documents, Chronology, Flowsheets. Even Rules is here. I can only assume having Rules is from concurrent development of the iPad version – access to viewing rules doesn’t make much sense in a mobile context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_884” width=”320” caption=”Mobile Health Summary is definitely useful for rounding or doing H&amp;amp;Ps.; You can edit the first three on the fly, the others are review-only.”]&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/08/photo-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health Summary is particularly useful. You can review or update problems, allergies and medications. The various histories are read-only. I couldn’t test it but adding/sending a prescription is clearly intended. Heath Summary has some inconsistencies, though. Stopping an allergy/problem/medication has three different icons. The chart navigation bar shifts up and down as you navigate (it should be stable above the section title.) Even with those problems, e-MDs Rounds packs a lot of power and information onto a little screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit Notes has a little surprise – you can start a mobile visit note. This could be a boon for charge capture at nursing home rounds or home visit. I’ve never used the Pocket PC Charge Capture tool from e-MDs so I don’t know how it compares. Reading visit notes is easy. Log notes are a little more buried – you have to find them in chronology. But most of the time, you’ll probably have log notes attached so it makes sense not to give Log Notes it’s own section like in Solution Series. It’d be nice to create a log note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all the usefulness hidden in a patient’s chart it’s a shame how difficult it is to look up a patient. One of the major timesavers in Solution Series is the ‘Comma Lookup’. So “Pl,J” gets you to “Ploudre, Jonathan” quickly. On a smaller screen with a software keyboard, that type of abbreviation is even more important. Unfortunately it’s not in Rounds. When you open to patients it defaults to a list rather than the more sensible patient search. When you do search, there’s options like searching by address. To me that’s very unlikely and shows a lack of focusing on mobile use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e-MDs Rounds is boutique software – by my guess, they are probably aiming for hundreds of users. This will never beat Angry Birds to the top of the charts on the App Store. I don’t have firm pricing information but I’ve heard it’s about $35/month. So around $400 for a year. For a first try, e-MDs Rounds shows that e-MDs is thinking big – it provides access to most of Chart. One can only wonder where they are on an iPad version of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, I fear e-MDs Rounds will end up like Solution Series – powerful but frustrating. It’s much slower to use by not having usability features like autocomplete or maintaining where you were when you log back in. This friction makes it less useful on rounds or call. Speed of use is particularly important on a mobile phone where user input is slower than on a desktop. It will be interesting to see how development progresses – will they spend more energy on adding features or on polishing the ones they have? There’s a broad foundation here, with focus on usability and polishing the experience this could be amazing. For now, it’s just a hint at the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s a ~15 minute video about getting better at using an EHR. Well, not really. It is about being creative but this idea of an ‘OK plateau’ and conscious learning fits with every doctor I known who has learned and EHR. After you get on autopilot, you just do the same thing over and over again. If you want to keep improving, you have to keep failing. You have to do the hard stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If we are going to really get Health IT, we need to be patient-centered. It’s generally being ignored now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern health is phenomenal: Public Health/Sanitation/Antibiotics. Now 7% of Wealthy vs 36% of Poor die of infection in 2011.– &lt;a href=&quot;http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/03/age-of-man/map-interactive&quot;&gt;National Geographic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With modern medicine, much of main causes of death can be modified/prevented/managed by medications. Heart Disease, Stroke, Diabetes. –&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm&quot;&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective medications (Great Evidence in Research), say for high blood pressure, don’t work if people don’t take them regularly. Half of patients self-discontinue. (Same/Worse for Statins.) – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19805653?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;Circulation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying causes of death are behavioral (Tobacco Use, Poor Diet, Inactivity.) – &lt;a href=&quot;http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/291/10/1238.abstract&quot;&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple SMS message can double efficacy in behavior change (Tobacco Cessation) – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60701-0/fulltext&quot;&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health Care and HIT organized like main frames. Centralized. Hospitals. Central Databases like in e-MDs. – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/eric_dishman_take_health_care_off_the_mainframe.html&quot;&gt;Ted.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on actionable data, we can make medical data useful for patients making behavioral change. – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_goetz_it_s_time_to_redesign_medical_data.html&quot;&gt;Wired Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software mechanics can enable behavioral change. – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/seth_priebatsch_the_game_layer_on_top_of_the_world.html&quot;&gt;Seth Priebatsch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to innovate on &lt;strong&gt;patient-centered&lt;/strong&gt; health IT.&lt;br /&gt;
Adherence and Behavior Change could be improved with phones our patients already have in their pocket. &lt;br /&gt;
We need to enable patients as  partners in their care.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; This being used by billing to track down 
 invoices still sitting out there waiting for action.  
 It will pull invoice with a balance and can be 
 broken down by financial group and payor.  
 This was created for use until e-MDS fixes 
 the insurance AR report.  There are still some 
 quirks to work out with this report but it may 
 be useful to get a snapshot of what invoice

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love reports that are ‘implemented’. Download if you might actually have your billing use it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dragon Remote Microphone and mobile dictation</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/dragon-remote-microphone/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-01T19:50:38-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/dragon-remote-microphone</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/08/dragonremotemicrophone.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been waiting for this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuance has found a way to finally cut the cord on dictation. In the past, dictation could be done with audio files on a mobile recorder. It doesn’t really work as a workflow – you don’t see/correct errors until after the download. They offer dication over a remote connection if you are dictating into a microphone hooked up to the local computer. Although I’m sure someone can use that, it’s not really remote dication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone has long been known to have some pretty sweet hardware including it’s microphone. Grumo Media (maker of awesome demo videos for startups) has an article about &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://grumomedia.com/how-to-record-great-voiceover-audio-with-an-iphone/&quot;&gt;how to use your iPhone to do great voiceovers&lt;/a&gt;. It’s already in my pocket, couldn’t I just use this to dictate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragon Remote Microphone does that. This requires 11.5 (for use with e-MDs that could be Professional which I use. Or Premium ought to work fine, too. &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/using-dragon-with-e-mds/&quot;&gt;No need to wait/spend for Medical. &lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now my workflow is this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Come out of a room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whip out my phone, hit the Microphone button in the App. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dicate a few sentences. Slip phone in pocket. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fast enough to feel like I can do it for just a few sentences. Very little friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-gets-more-mobile&quot;&gt;It get’s more mobile…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using it in the office is slick since it saves me from logging into my desktop to dictate. And saves me walking to the desktop, albeit only 20 feet away. In the middle of the morning when someone is waiting reducing the ~30 seconds means I’m more likely to finish off the note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also means I can use my iPhone to dictate into my iPad in e-MDs. Or it means I can VPN my phone into my work network and then dictate from my home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-well-does-it-work&quot;&gt;How well does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accuracy is difficult to benchmark. On my desktop, I use a relatively nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-USB-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000AP1RE8&quot;&gt;$80 Samson USB Microphone.&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly the remote microphone doesn’t work as well. It seems a little slower than doing it locally. But it’s still more on the ‘magical’ than the ‘frustrating’ side. And for shorter dication (paragraph or two) the convenience and speed clearly outweigh the decrease in accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It incidentally fixes a longstanding bug for me. When you remote into a computer running Dragon, it would never work again. I used to restart Dragon to dictate again. Wait half a minute or more for it to restart. More Friction. Turns out, switching profiles works after RDP but I had never tried that since I only had one profile. Now I switch from Desktop to Remote profiles and it continues to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really is changing my work and will help me get things done quicker with better narrative in my documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Print to file to work around inability to export</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/print-to-file-to-work-around-inability-to-export/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-01T07:59:24-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/print-to-file-to-work-around-inability-to-export</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a lover of ‘postprocessing’ in excel. If I can just get the data, I can do my own analysis, thank you. (Again, I’m going to plug my ‘&lt;a href=&quot;/2011/data-driven-practice/&quot;&gt;Data Driven Practice&lt;/a&gt;.’ Amazing what you can do with pivot tables and autofilter!) Sometimes e-MDs is set up to let you download/export data. Any crystal report, for instance, can be saved as a file to process in Excel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But data is not always exportable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this problem, brought up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://supportcenter.e-mds.com/ics/forum/Client/Common/ContentView.aspx?contentID=106028&quot;&gt;supportcenter recently&lt;/a&gt;. How do I make sure that followup notes get faxed back to the primary care provider. You can get faxing/sign off data from the treasure chest of Chart Audit. But Chart Audit doesn’t allow exporting, just printing. So do I have to print out 30 pages and &lt;em&gt;manually scan through with a highlighter&lt;/em&gt;? (Cue Next Line: That’s what computers are supposed to do….)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;printing-to-file&quot;&gt;Printing to file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I love about Mac OS X is that printing to file (pdf) is baked in. Whatever mac you use, whatever program you’re in. Hit print, choose ‘Print to PDF’ and now you’ve got an electronic copy. Windows can also print to PDF with free software but since post-processing in Excel is the goal, that’s not the way to go here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick is to create generic/text only printer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/07/Generic_Text_Only_Icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Windows XP has trouble exporting device manager info. So they recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/127156&quot;&gt;installing a generic/text only driver and printing to that to create a file.&lt;/a&gt;. If you follow the instructions there, you’ll be able to do the same with Chart Audit. But this is the  key step:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/07/Generic-Text-Only-Driver-Selection.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/07/Generic-Text-Only-Driver-Selection.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In e-MDs you can control printing options in Chart. But some things will just go to your default printer in Windows. So to print to file, you may need to first set your default printer to the generic/text only, then do the printing, then set it back to your default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text file that comes out (if it was a table of data) can usually be pretty easily processed in Excel at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Interuptions and Practice</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/interuptions-and-practice/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-26T19:59:06-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/interuptions-and-practice</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Multitasking is generally a myth. People think they can multi-task but the reality is that all the tasks they are doing are taking a hit. In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1977523,00.html&quot;&gt;article in Time magazine&lt;/a&gt; 97.5% of the general population are not successful at multi-tasking. So when faced with two tasks at once, say Driving and Texting, we’re more dangerous. The New York Times has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/19/technology/20090719-driving-game.html&quot;&gt;great simulation of texting and driving&lt;/a&gt;. It’s really easy to do without multi-tasking. But it becomes frantically difficult while doing two tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, go spend a minute or two on the  test and see how you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interruptions-and-multitasking&quot;&gt;Interruptions and Multitasking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we don’t really multitask then interruptions need to be reconsidered. Are they stealing attention and concentration? Are we creating ‘distracted doctoring’? I’m sure no reasonable patient would be cool with his doctor texting while she writes a prescription. Yet we accept interruptions all the time. This has impact on usability/simplicity. Software that is tuned for faster performance of the doctor is probably safer. Faster task completion reduces the chance that we’ll be interrupted or tempted into multi-tasking. When doing complex tasks, it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20819867&quot;&gt;can take a doctor about 10 seconds to resume&lt;/a&gt; after interruption. When you add dozens of interruptions a day, there’s a real impact on performance (and life-enjoyment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you reduce interruptions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid ‘real-time’ documenting: Patients will interrupt you while you’re documenting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speed up common actions (macros) so you can complete them quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Batching non-clinical work (do before work, at lunch, etc). Downside: less &lt;em&gt;flow&lt;/em&gt; for your nurse and patients not currently at the clinic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Respect your nurses’s attention, too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stock needed items in the room (Seriously, leaving the room regularly is a huge timewaster.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exploit messaging whenever possible. E-mail gets checked all day long but avoids  interruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor (Where's Innovation?)</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitor-wheres-innovation/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-12T11:23:22-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitor-wheres-innovation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2003, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/hypertension/&quot;&gt;JNC 7&lt;/a&gt; recommended Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (&lt;strong&gt;ABPM&lt;/strong&gt;) for a number of clinical situations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suspected white-coat hypertension in patients with hypertension and no target organ damage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apparent drug resistance (office resistance)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hypotensive symptoms with antihypertensive medication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Episodic hypertension&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autonomic dysfunction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;show-me-the-money&quot;&gt;Show me the money….&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aafp.org/afp/2003/0601/p2343.html&quot;&gt;main critiques was that it increased cost of care&lt;/a&gt; without necessarily improving outcomes. At that time, it looked like it might cost patients $100 to $300. The portable monitor with software might cost $5000. And it might cost $60-$100 for time/materials for a provider. (I wonder why they calculate it so high?) Medicare did start covering it for white-coat hypertension but would only re-imburse $60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in: a portable blood pressure cuff with memory for a few hundred readings costs &lt;em&gt;$5000 in 2003&lt;/em&gt;. For comparison, a Palm Pilot in &lt;em&gt;1996 cost $300&lt;/em&gt;. And the original Palm Pilot could run a portable blood pressure cuff without breaking a sweat. And store months of data. And have great usability. ABPM isn’t necessarily an expensive technology. Feels like getting charged $14 for a bandaid because you’re at the ER. Price gouging…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go forward to 2011.  A Welch-Allyn ABPM that’s compatible with e-MDs costs $2-3000 + $500 for software to connect it to the EMR. Where’s the innovation? Considering other technology, shouldn’t the price be lower?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/06/abpm50.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you search on Amazon for ‘ABPM’ you’ll find this $400 import from China. We just got one at my clinic. The hardware is reasonably nice. It’s small, lightweight, sturdy. The usability on the machine is not that great but it still would take under a couple minutes to get it ready for a new patient including popping in some AA batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get to hooking it to your computer, it gets downright ugly. Horrible install instructions. Confusing software, arcane organization. Unsigned Driver that Windows complains about when you try to install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s $2100 cheaper than Welch-Allyn. I could have 6 of them for the same price. And as ugly as the software is, a person could make it work pretty quickly after they learned the quirks. It’s cheap enough that the complaints about reimbursement start to ring hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may still be coverage issues for patients (not all insurances have the same coverage) but this ends up costing like a chest XR and has significant value for solving clinical problems about compliance and efficacy for hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last month, Journal-Watch had an article about ABPM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;white-coat-effect-accounts-for-one-third-of-resistant-hypertension-cases-ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-reveals-the-prevalence-and-characteristics-of-true-versus-white-coat-resistant-hypertension&quot;&gt;White-Coat Effect Accounts for One Third of Resistant Hypertension Cases Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring reveals the prevalence and characteristics of true versus white-coat resistant hypertension.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of resistant hypertension (RH), defined as persistent
elevation in office-measured blood pressure (BP) despite the use of three
or more antihypertensive agents (including a diuretic), is not well
established. To find out more, investigators used data from the Spanish
Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) Registry, funded by the
developer of an ABPM platform and network. Of 68,045 patients treated for
hypertension, 8295 had RH (51.4% men; mean age, 64.4; mean duration of
hypertension, 11.1 years). Of these, half were obese, 13% were smokers, and
32% had type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to ABPM findings, 62.5% of the RH patients had true RH, and 37.5%
had normal values on ABPM and were considered to have white-coat
hypertension. Compared with the white-coat group, the true-RH group had
higher rates of cigarette smoking, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy,
microalbuminuria, and previous cardiovascular disease. In addition, the
true-RH patients were younger, were more likely to be male, and had a
longer duration of hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comment:&lt;/strong&gt; In this large cohort of patients who underwent ambulatory blood
pressure monitoring, about one in eight had resistant hypertension. Of
these, one third turned out to have white-coat hypertension. These findings
suggest that to ensure a correct diagnosis and to assist in management
decisions, ABPM is warranted in all hypertensive patients whose BP is not
controlled on three or more drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Simvastatin (Zocor) 80mg Report</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/simvastatin-zocor-80mg-report/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-10T15:26:14-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/simvastatin-zocor-80mg-report</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/06/Simvastatin.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Simvastatin Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year in March, the FDA fired a warning shot about the increased risks with the 80 mg dose of simvastatin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm205215.htm&quot;&gt;FDA Warning, March 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last year at the e-MDs user conference I used that as an example of &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/data-driven-practice/&quot;&gt;how to do a quick and dirty report from crystal&lt;/a&gt; see the video of how  to do that report in 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm256581.htm&quot;&gt;Yesterday, the FDA strengthened the recommendation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not start new patients at the 80-mg dose;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue patients at the 80-mg level only if they have been on the drug for 12 months or longer and have not shown signs of myopathy (the risks for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are greatest in the first year of therapy);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use other treatments if patients’ LDL targets aren’t met with the 40-mg simvastatin dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which, I would add that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Studies on potency say going from 40 to 80mg changes average reduction of LDL from 40 to 46%. (No change, if you ask me.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are decent studies suggesting that on a panel basis you might get much better cardiovascular risk reduction by focusing on adherence (length of prescription, lower co-pay by using generic medication, sychronizing prescriptions to reduce pharmacy visits, strategizing on ways to reduce forgetting, tracking adherence to recall patients who self-discontinue, exploring patient willingness and understanding of treatment.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of my favorites: Given a $20 copay and limits to 30 day supply, how many people are still taking their statin 4 years later? &lt;strong&gt;About 5%&lt;/strong&gt; [J GEN INTERNAL MED 2004, 19:638-645&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simvastatin-report&quot;&gt;Simvastatin Report&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple report that organizes by Provider and then Patient taking 80mg Dose of Simvastatin for e-MDs. This is a quick-n-dirty report. It doesn’t validate things like having a Sig of 1/2 tablet by mouth daily or pay attention to date (it was a couple years ago). I still think it’s  useful caulk – it fills a gap of finding patients by dose of a specific medication which can’t be done with built-in tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philosopical Interlude:&lt;/strong&gt; reporting/analytics isn’t a tech issue. This is sociopolitical. Who’s going to run it? Who’s going to contact patients? Or are you going to contact patients? What would you say or plan? Don’t just download this. Decide what you think is best then use this to help make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

Panel Size.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general math behind defining a provider panel isn’t complicated. But if you’re trying to have useful discussions about panel management (hard!) a shared vocabulary can really help. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aafp.org/fpm/2007/0400/p44.html&quot;&gt;Mark Murray in Family Practice Mangement&lt;/a&gt; has a decent starting point. The Map is a way of tracking the issues – should make sense after you’ve read the article. Although it’s more sophistication than I’ve ever seen actually used/managed, it can help in separating overlapping issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to start…..&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So the theme I pull out of this: Patients have a stronger preference for access than doctors have. We’re all used to creating walls to protect us from too much access. To me, that might be  a symptom of not being careful about managing your panel size. (See my recent &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/provider-panel-report/&quot;&gt;Provider Panel Report&lt;/a&gt; as a starting spot.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Provider Panel Report</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a basic report for provider panel size. It’s based on patients that have visited the clinic (not just in the database). My clinic has been using e-MDs for 3 years  so looking at all visits has been an OK shortcut. Most experts recommend using a shorter interval for estimating panel size (12-18 months, typically.) That could be adjusted pretty easily in Crystal Reports, if it was important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report pays attention to exempted patients (Using ‘Exempt from Reports’ in Demographics) if you use that in your clinic process for transferred or discharged patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;★ Don’t miss: &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/provider-panel-map/&quot;&gt;Provider Panel Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adjusting-not-worth-it-for-me&quot;&gt;Adjusting? Not worth it for me.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously providers have different recall style (doctors who encourage more frequent feedback need an effectively smaller panel) and different panel makeup (male versus female providers, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time I used a set of conversion factors to adjust for the age/sex of patients. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://primarycareforall.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Panels-in-Primary-Care.pdf&quot;&gt;See Panel Equity Article&lt;/a&gt;.) Interesting experiment – some female providers at my clinic have 85% female patients. Some docs do OB (and see lots of pediatric patient who have a lot of visits.) But rank order of panels was essentially unchanged. This simple panel measure is good enough for our clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;panel-size-is-clinic-wide-too&quot;&gt;Panel Size is clinic-wide, too.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I learned by looking at panel size is that larger clinic dynamics matter. I could fix my availability and have a right-sized panel and still have problems. If a partner is overburdened, the patients will spill over. To really get success in managing panels, I think you have to consider  the whole clinic as much as individual providers. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rethinking Search in EHRs</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/rethinking-search-in-ehrs/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-30T09:57:37-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/rethinking-search-in-ehrs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a stroll down memory lane for a moment. In the mid-1990s the Web exploded into mainstream. It started with a few sites with academic papers, recipes, jokes, etc. Suddenly it had more information than you could possibly get to. The rapid change in complexity was astounding. Into that spot came one of the early iconic Web companies. Yahoo. (Aside: Before they went public, they had a contest to create a marketing tagline. They gave away 50 baseball caps to their favorite entries. I still have mine. My entry – “Yahoo, wasting time made efficient.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how Yahoo tamed  complexity over 15 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/05/3786863152_31559284df_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/05/3786863254_8549fdb860_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/05/3786863674_629e018e07_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I cheated. I skipped from 1995 to 2009 between the second and third screenshoot. But the trend is clear. What started as a way to tame complexity is now itself complex. So, although this designed (it’s not pure entropy), there’s clearly a limit on how much information we can access through a directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my clinic, we use a primary ordering template. It’s got a Yahoo problem – we have 3000 items in the template. Even when you know the template like the back of your hand, it takes real time and attention to navigate through. There are limits to usability as size increases. You can manage this somewhat through good &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture&quot;&gt;information architecture&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e-MDs main solution to this complexity is templates. You can create hierarchical templates that allow you to delve down and select items. Personally I think templates are their most successful custom widget. e-MDs created a number of non-standard interface widgets with varying degrees of success. So while having free text insertion everywhere has some flexibility, the darn free text widget &lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/03/freetext.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; is too small and difficult to select.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Templates were designed for tablet use and if you never need to use a keyboard, the template is impressive in it’s speed. (Tablet mode never worked for me becuase I need to enter text regularly and handwriting was inefficient and frustrating. Flipping back and forth between tablet and laptop mode didn’t really work for me) It’s essentially a group of buttons that are ~ 200 by 25 pixels. That’s  big enough to be easily tappable (especially compared to the 6 by 6 pixels of “free text”.) e-MDs was designed when &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_display_standard&quot;&gt;XGA was the most common display standard&lt;/a&gt;. 1024 x 768 is still a common resolution – my iPad uses it, for example. You lose usable space by all the chrome around the information (See: &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/e-mds-interface-janitor/&quot;&gt;Interface Janitor&lt;/a&gt;) Still, you can fit 4 columns of 25 buttons – 100 could be on the screen at once. If you had a perfect outline, a 2 layer hierarchy  could hold 625 items, a 3 layer could hold 15K items. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thinking-about-search&quot;&gt;Thinking about Search&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for hierarchy. Now let’s think about Search as Interface. I think we can agree what internet company to look at. Here’s Google’s 1997 and then 2009 homepage.
&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/05/1997-300x181.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/05/google-2009-fade-in-large-300x168.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy, that really hides the complexity! Interestingly, Google’s gotten much better during that interval – it’s faster than ever to use. It corrects for human constraints. Typos, for example. Or slow typing – Google Suggest adds autocompleting to search terms so you don’t have to type as much. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/instant/&quot;&gt;Google Instant&lt;/a&gt; goes even further by doing the navigating while you are still typing. They say that saves 2-5 seconds per search. So that same box gets more powerful and quicker-to-use at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put it in strategic terms, Google aims to simplify complexity so users can get back to what they are trying to do. Contrast that with a screenshot from e-MDs. So, 6  characters into hypertension (by far one of the most common chronic disease), and how are things looking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-30-at-9.31.26-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stop-disrespecting-doctors&quot;&gt;Stop disrespecting doctors!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows a lack of insight about search and modern software. Seriously: Why do you have to designate ‘Search by’ options? A computer from 10 years ago could easily handle all 4 searches and merging the results into a single list. A couple megabytes of data at most. If you type in a number, you’re clearly doing a CPT search. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t make us think.&lt;/strong&gt; Even though the system has practice-specific ICD frequency data – it doesn’t use that to sort results. No, it uses ICD codes in numerical order. ‘Cause that makes a lot of sense for a doctor providing care. Disrespectful. Or couldn’t it automatically fallover to the full search if your short search fails? Use a common abbreviation (HTN) and how does that work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a science behind this. I think the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://searchpatterns.org/library.php&quot;&gt;Search Patterns&lt;/a&gt; get’s it best. It explains common design patterns and user behaviors. This isn’t something where EHRs have to create a new field of understanding. Dealing with complexity is bread and butter for all knowledge workers. Rather EHRs need to learn to apply best practices pervasively. It’s a respect for the importance of what’s going on here. If it was your health, would you want a time-limited Doc using Yahoo or Google? Doctoring is sacred work and we’re hoping that tech-enabled care can allow doctors to  transcend some of our own limits (like memory or handwriting quality.) But we’re getting tech-encumbered care (hold on, I’ve got to click about six or seven things before I can pay attention to you.) The tech gives us new powers but always extracts tradeoffs by distracting us or making work more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search isn’t &lt;em&gt;the answer&lt;/em&gt;. But it’s one of the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Continuity Report</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/continuity-report/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-13T09:50:57-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/continuity-report</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This report is a simple measure of patient-centered continuity. So, when one of my patients visits the clinic, what’s the chance that they saw me for the visit? 1.0 would be every patient sees me; 0.0 would be every patient sees one of my partners. &lt;strong&gt;Contrast:&lt;/strong&gt; Doctor-centered continuity would be when I work, how many of the patients I see were mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a basic percentage of billed office/hospital visits – new or established patients. There are more sophisticated measures like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3806028&quot;&gt;MMCI&lt;/a&gt; but this is more data/inisight than most practices ever consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report covers the last 365 days before the report and summarizes by month. Like I said in &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/data-driven-practice/&quot;&gt;Data Driven Practice&lt;/a&gt;, the right number of parameters is usually &lt;em&gt;Zero&lt;/em&gt;. So there’s intentionally no options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/05/continuity.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Continuity Crystal Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-does-continuity-rock&quot;&gt;Why does Continuity Rock?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cancer patients with low primary care continuity are ~4x more likely to have an ER visit than those with high continuity. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12886178&quot;&gt;See Pubmed Article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improves Satisfaction (Patient and Doc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved Patient Safety (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17327525&quot;&gt;See Pubmed Article&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improves Quality while reducing cost (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15798043&quot;&gt;See Pubmed again&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish it was that easy: just manage and improve continuity. If you asked me a year ago, access/continuity would have been one of my big successes at my clinic. I had created this and a few other related reports. We had a decent single-page dashboard that you can see in my &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/data-driven-practice/&quot;&gt;data driven practice presentation&lt;/a&gt;. It was a way to use &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/practice-based-evidence/&quot;&gt;Practice-based Evidence&lt;/a&gt; to improve care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/05/cowboy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened: it fizzled. My partners and I were originally looking at and thinking about data. In one discussion we got about a minute away from the grail – we almost made a management experiment using real-time data. We were going to change scheduling to improve the docs who needed the most help. But there was some issues with recent reception stress so we decided to wait. And essentially there’s never been any momentum again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call this the ‘&lt;strong&gt;Cowboy Problem&lt;/strong&gt;.’ You can’t fix continuity like a lone cowboy. It takes a team to do it. It doesn’t matter how good my reports are if no one is willing to look at them and think. Generally continuity ought to be a responsibility of reception. They are the ones with the power to create continuity by scheduling patients with their doctor. But in most clinics, docs/nurses are afraid of letting reception have the responsibility. “My schedule is full today and I have that difficult patient coming next. That kid with a cough will have to see a partner or go to urgent care.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So don’t waste your time downloading the report above – unless you could actually do something with it. Could you show someone? Get a conversation going? Actually use the data to figure out the problems with how patients are scheduled?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Peak versus Sustained Charting</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/peak-versus-sustained-charting/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-06T09:53:25-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/peak-versus-sustained-charting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week I had a conversation with a medical transcriptionist who’s struggling with her new job. The company that just took over has an ‘On-the-job’ clock but also has a ‘Transcribing window open’ clock. She feels a pressure to try to make them match – 8 hours of work should be 8 hours of transcription. Since she’s a human (not a computer or machine) that’s completely unrealistic. 1 bathroom break in 8 hours: failure. Even if you consider labor laws – 15 minute breaks and a lunch – it’s impossible to sustain attention that long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In medical transcription, they often judge performance in lines/hour. A line is 60-70 characters (with or without spaces counted, depending on the company). 350 lines/hour is pretty solid work so it ends up a sustained rate of something like 75 wpm in typing terms. Nowadays, many medical transcriptionists are actually doing editing of computer transcription. They aren’t allowed to use abbreviations to expand their word count. So ‘COPD’ doesn’t expand into ‘Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder’ to get extra lines. On a good dictations, she might get to 1.7 real time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, it seems lately that the radiologists are working like the transcriptionists – &lt;strong&gt;editing&lt;/strong&gt;. I had a patient this week with flank pain and I ordered a CT-KUB. The result didn’t arrive like it was supposed to so I went onto our PACS system. I found the study, there wasn’t yet the full report but the audio was there. When I clicked I heard the radiologist say: &lt;em&gt;“See the approved Tech’s Report.”&lt;/em&gt; And a little later a 1 page document with the 6mm stone and mild hydronephrosis showed up. So apparently hydroneprhosis is a tech-level documentation that gets confirmed by the radiologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the CT report shows the limits of &lt;em&gt;Peak Charting&lt;/em&gt;: After all the thinking/evaluation/etc, a page can be dictated in 5 words. Honestly, if the radiologists worked at it, it could be a single character (Checkmark!) But no radiologist is just saying checkmark, checkmark, checkmark. The thinking/examining takes lots of real time so sustained charting is dramatically slower. And on complicated scans the dictation probably slows to something like 100-150 words per minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;peak-charting-in-e-mds&quot;&gt;Peak Charting in e-MDs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peak charting for me would be a routine cold. My roomer might have used a shortcut, entered the HPI/Vitals, there’s a basic exam and plan. Assuming it’s a complete cookie cutter visit, I could theoretically just sign-off. In my macro-enabled world, I’d hit one macro to close to the E&amp;amp;M; coder, glance at it to check, then hit enter, look at my note conclusion printing options, and hit my signoff macro. On a visit like this in the middle of the day, that’s actually about 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit, of course, lasts much much longer. There’s small talk, figuring out what the patient is actually worried about, examining, educating, etc. And I usually try to add a little ‘&lt;a href=&quot;/2011/using-dragon-with-e-mds/&quot;&gt;narrative&lt;/a&gt;’. So, I’ll type a sentence or two into the HPI to amplify. And I’ll update some social history. Still my peak charting will still be well under a minute for a simple single-problem visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustained Charting is harder to measure. On a couple problem visit (both easy/routine problems), navigating back and forth eats up real time. I might be able to use a preclick ROS, say, but I need to add a few more for the second problem. Same thing with the exam. And if I’m finishing up the plan (aiming for real time, if I want finished visit summary), there’s jumping back and forth between plan templates to describe discussions, medications, followup, testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I used to do was open the free text after an assessment and type something like, “fu1w inip. dsal. dholdabx.” And with the magic of autohotkey and my abbrevation efforts in the past few years, out would pop “Follow up in 1 week if not improving. Discussed and demonstrated use of saline sinus lavage for symptom reduction. Prescribed antibiotics but a plan to hold and monitor symptoms for now.” So something like 7 seconds typing. And a second or two to click on the right &lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/03/freetext.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now trying to keep plan as ‘structured data’ inside a template since that’s the current requirement for having it print in the visit summary. It takes me longer than a narrative blob with abbreviations like above. If I typed 10 words a minute, templating might be faster. More than time, though, it takes attention. Once I have the freetext open, I can lift my eyes from the screen and glance at the patient. (That’s Touchtyping!) There’s no reading or finding involved. With selecting on a template, there’s finding the right template, finding the followup button, finding the discussions button, etc. I know I could optimize that with preclicks (and editing to match my plan) but it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/how-much-time-can-macros-save/&quot;&gt;local maximum again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For faster Sustained Charting, jumping back and forth needs to be quicker (without focused attention.) And I need a way to generate lots of structured data (without focused attention). The jumping I’ve got covered with macros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;F1 jumps to ROS template&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;F2 jumps to exam template&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;F3 adds a diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;F4 (on hiatus, used to prescribe via the health summary, but that doesn’t document right.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;F5-F8 jumps to the plan template for the first through fourth problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generating structured data without focused attention is harder. I think the best model is autocompleting like the location bar in a web-browser. That could behave a lot like a free text blob. I can leverage abbreviations I know (CBC could order the lab….)  so it wouldn’t be hard to use. But hacking this on top of our templates is inelegant. I’m definitely not going to parse the template XML. This is something that would be much better built-in. I probably will create it for my purposes but it’ll never be something I could release for wider usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can do notes in near real-time but it changes me into the patient’s data entry technician. I need a way to get the work done but limit the impact/focus on charting so I can focus on the person instead.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Plan-Do-Study-Act and Meaningful Use</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/pdsa-and-meaningful-use/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-24T22:55:51-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/pdsa-and-meaningful-use</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Plan-Do-Study-Act is a methodology for improvement. It’s the same basic theory about experimental sciences (hypothesis, experiement, analysis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally it works like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan out how something is supposed to work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Study the results&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analyze how to make it better. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refine Plan…..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Meaningful Use, I think most organizations would do well to have an explicit process. Written Plan, Written implementations (how’s it going to be communicated/trained/etc). One area MU makes life easier is now the studying can be as simple as running the MU reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what I’m thinking. We’re aiming for a clinic to have 20+ of these for each of the core and most of the menu options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;smoking-status&quot;&gt;Smoking status&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plan&quot;&gt;Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who:&lt;/strong&gt; Clinical staff (Nurse/MA)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What:&lt;/strong&gt; Verify Tobacco Status on patients &amp;gt; 13 years old&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When:&lt;/strong&gt; While rooming, every visit (it’s a vital sign.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;How:&lt;/strong&gt; Ask patient tobacco status. Get to tobacco status either through
CC complaint or through Left Health Summary. If current tobacco status
in chart is not ‘orange star’ transfer it to orange star section.  If
no changes needed, just click the ‘review button’.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Why:&lt;/strong&gt; Tobacco is a major preventable cause of disease.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Goal:&lt;/strong&gt; 50% requirement for MU but aiming for &amp;gt;80% like med lists or allergies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doing&quot;&gt;Doing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Practice:&lt;/strong&gt; Use Health summary (instead of cc template) after
entering vital signs. Do in the room in real time. (We need to
eliminate post-its for vitals from some nurses.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best Practice Script:&lt;/strong&gt; Q: Why do you ask every time I come in? A:
Tobacco is one of the most important preventable health problems so we
double check all the time. (Note, answer isn’t: The goverment told us
to.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Lead Nurse will personally train 4 nurses, one each from
each pod by Friday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Each Trainer Nurse will train each nurse/MA in their section
by next Wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;
Any training issues/questions will be communicated to Lead Nurse to

   <title>More Dragon with e-MDs</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/more-dragon-with-e-mds/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-11T19:41:32-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/more-dragon-with-e-mds</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote recently about &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/using-dragon-with-e-mds/&quot;&gt;Dragon 11 (not just medical) with e-MDs &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve failed dictation multiple times in the past – I’d say I’ve given a real try at least 5 times in the last 6 years. Improvements helped but I still failed.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-USB-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000AP1RE8/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&amp;ie;=UTF8&amp;qid;=1302575395&amp;sr;=1-5&quot;&gt;better microphone&lt;/a&gt; helped. (I hate putting a headphone on and off. This looks like I’m on radio.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making a custom targeted vocabulary (from my previous dictations) helped, too. It’s only 23K word but they are words that I actually say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the error rate was always high-enough that it felt like it was more work than typing (definitely more error prone.) And I’d go crazy trying to get some sentence or word recognized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Dragon 11 has been a revelation. Much faster. More accurate.&lt;/strong&gt; I enjoy using it! Feels somewhat like using a transcriptionist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of doing ‘real-time’ Visit Summaries, it’s still not part of my workflow. But it’s still great for complicated non-templatable visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I thought about note navigation macros, but it feels pretty low priority right now. The main macro (which opens up notepad in place of free text and pastes back into free text) is totally useful all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my setup: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delete all the hotkeys in Dragon except Microphone On/off as Numberpad +&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Numberpad - in free text (my macro), or Numberpad + for in templates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t really used Dragon for messaging or order tracking since it’s not my current workflow. Maybe someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;very-simple-dragon-macro&quot;&gt;Very simple Dragon Macro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/04/dragon11.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Dragon 11 Macro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Amazon Web Services</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/amazon-web-services/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-05T22:48:45-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/amazon-web-services</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I did when I got to start testing e-MDs 7.0 was look at the Visit Summary. I was horrified and delighted. Horrified at the layout, design and usability for patients. Delighted that Meaningful Use requires standards – I could fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My process of rewriting required setting up a server to host the formatting. I decided to go with Amazon Web Services. Mostly based on reputation – Amazon.com isn’t going out of business any time soon. And their expertise in running one of the biggest sites on the Net makes them very capable and managing servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pretty much went with basic defaults: A Micro Instance, the Amazon Linux Image, Nginx for webserving. If you pre-purchase this server it’s pretty inexpensive. ~$50 for a year or ~$80 for 3 years. And Amazon guarantees 99.95% Uptime. That’s about 1 hour downtime during my work year. Given that they do planned maintenance in the middle of the night, I suspect there will be effectively 99.99% uptime. Now that I have it up I’m not intending to touch it – no administrator errors for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this inexpensive virtual server outperforms e-MD’s official server. I tested with apache benchmark, 100 requests, 5 Concurrent Users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;My Amazon.com Server&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;e-MDs cdastyle server&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Requests/second&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4.4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Longest Request&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;661ms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4730ms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;

   <title>MU Smoking Status Template</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/mu-smoking-status-template/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-31T15:03:05-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/mu-smoking-status-template</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I actually changed the orange starred part of the template so I can document both for MU and PQRI (tobacco assessment clinical )quality measure. So I only have to document the status once and then if I prescribe a smoking cessation medication or counsel a patient (and document in the plan section) I get credit for both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tobacco assessment and counseling measure that is part of the MU Clinical Quality Measure rule isn’t tracked by the MU codes in the orange star tobacco template. That report uses the PQRI codes as dictated by CMS. e-mds doesn’t have those codes as part of the tobacco template (only the MU codes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the changes I made&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I added a child to “Never Smoked” that is a force answer called “Check for quality measure”, which is also a default as checked. It doesn’t drop any language into the health summary but does have the PQRI code for nonsmoker attached as an extended attribute. The MU code is still part of the “Never Smoked” click.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Under Past Smoker, I made the Cigarette or Cigar childs forced answers and added the PQRI extended attribute for past smoker to each of those choices. The MU code extended attribute is logged when you clikc past smoker which wasn’t changed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Under Current smoker - selecting “Current smoker” will log the PQRI code for current smoker and the MU code is with the “Everyday smoker” or “Intermittent smoker”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These PQRI codes will satisfy the first part of the Tobacco Use and Intervention report for Core requirement #11
the second part of the report is actual intervention - that gets satisfied if you prescribe a smoking cessation medication or you document counseling of smoking cessation in a plan template under “Smoking Status” which is in about every plan template.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Using (Not Just Medical) Dragon with e-MDs</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/using-dragon-with-e-mds/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-27T18:12:15-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/using-dragon-with-e-mds</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Voice Recognition has been just around the corner for at least 5 years. My clinic has a number of docs who’ve been pretty sucessful over the years. We bought Dragon Professional years ago and spent some &lt;em&gt;serious cash&lt;/em&gt; on some Medical Vocabularies. I’ve tried it repeatedly over the years but my dictation is pretty error-prone and frustrating. I get motivated for a while and then lose steam a week or two later. Anyone who’s read any of this site will know: I use the keyboard (with macros and abbreviations galore.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’ve hit a &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/how-much-time-can-macros-save/&quot;&gt;local maximum&lt;/a&gt; and more macros/abbreviations won’t really save me time. If I try to re-design my workflow for speed, I need better ways of doing 2 things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I need faster &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/snappy-charting/&quot;&gt;narrative medicine&lt;/a&gt; so I can put more flavor into my notes. Plain templates makes for pretty bland notes. That’s where Dragon being faster could really speed things up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I needs faster way to collect &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/snappy-charting/&quot;&gt;structured data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;The answer is autocomplete.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m intending to make an autocompleter that adds diagnoses, prescribes meds, and captures my plan. I think it’ll bring the snappy feeling to much of my charting. Just like I currently have snappy for order tracking and taskman with my &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/e-mds-macros/&quot;&gt;e-MDs macros&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years go by, Dragon gets better and better. With all the work, it seems like upgrading could improve things. The problem is that the Professional Version is locked out of EHRs. Nuance says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This edition of Dragon does not support dictation directly into Electronic Medical Record (EMR) Systems. For EMR support, please use Dragon Medical Edition.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Problem: Dragon Medical Edition costs  $1600 and feels like ‘This is a &lt;em&gt;hospital bandaid&lt;/em&gt; so it costs &lt;em&gt;$24&lt;/em&gt;” So even if you don’t need all the higher-end features of the Medical Edition, you’re stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say Dragon Medical @ $1600, saves you 10 minutes a day (based on my current usage, that’s my guess once I’m up to speed.) So ROI for me is about 9 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragon Premium costs $150. Say it’s not nearly as efficient and only saves 8 minutes. Still ROI is a little over  1 month. Add in a few hours of training and setup, and we’re talking 2-3 months for a significant workflow redesign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My real question: &lt;strong&gt;Is Premium even less efficient than Dragon Medical&lt;/strong&gt;? I’m sure they’ve tuned Dragon just like they’ve done for teenage speakers or for speakers with a Great Lakes Accent. (I’m not kidding, those are improvements in recent Dragon.) And tuning improves accuracy I’m sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Accuracy is a neverending quest. As a family doc, my dictation is much closer to regular english than it is to, say, an MRI report from a radiologist. if I was a radiologist, I wouldn’t even hesitate to have Dragon Medical with all the optimal training and microphone and custom macros. But my use case is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think using &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/practice-based-evidence/&quot;&gt;practice-based evidence&lt;/a&gt; is the key. I start with an empty vocabulary. Luckily I have about 3 years of dictations in electronic documents so I feed that into Dragon. Boom: I’ve got a custom dictionary of ~25K words that I’ve personally said with language adaptations for my style of wordiness. I don’t have a report (yet) but I’ll be adding words from my e-MDs visit notes, too. Those notess I won’t have language adaptation since I almost never dictate the same as what our generated text would say. I’ll add a list of words of every drug I’ve written in the past few years. I’ll add a list of every diagnosis I’ve done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will make a dramatically more customized vocabulary than I’d get with Dragon Medical out of the box. And a relatively small vocabulary so performance will be better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a small macro that turns my microphone on (and switches to Notepad to get around the limitation in Dragon Medical). Then  when I’m finished, I hit the same key again. That turns off the macro and pastes it back into the free text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-1&quot;&gt;Version 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Numlock::
IfWinActive, Free Text
{
WinGetPos, xpos, ypos, width, height, A
run, Notepad
WinWaitActive, Untitled - Notepad
WinMove, A,,%xpos%,%ypos%,%width%,%height%
Send {NumpadAdd}
return
}
IfWinActive, Untitled - Notepad
{
Send {NumpadAdd}
sleep 50
Send {Control down}
Send a
Send x
Send {Control up}
Send !F
Send !x
Send !n
IfWinExist, Free Text
{
WinActivate, Free Text
WinWaitActive, Free Text
}
Send {Control down}
Send v
Send {Control up}
send !s
}
return
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-setup&quot;&gt;Other Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put Dragon in Tray Mode. Screen space is golden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-version-note-integration&quot;&gt;Next Version: Note Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we really are going to ‘integrate with your EMR’, we need a macro that makes it easy to dictate. I’m thinking I’ll make a toolbar that covers the note navigation toolbar. It’ll be hardwired to the appropriate free texts. So ROS will go to that free text. And Assessment will go to the free text after each assessments. (I’ll have several assessment buttons since I often have multiple) By eliminating trying to click the tiny little free text circles (You know, &lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/03/freetext.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;) it should be much less stressful to dictate and to hop around the note. That hopping is part of what stresses me out. I am typically going back and forth. As dictation gets better and better the going up and down the note start to take more time respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to over-estimate here but I think my little note navigator part will actually make Dragon faster in e-MDs than Dragon Medical. I’m going to be using this with Dragon 11 Professional (since that’s what I have) but it ought to work fine with Dragon 11 Premium  that costs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Nuance-Communications-Inc-K609A-G00-11-0-NaturallySpeaking/dp/B003VNCROU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid;=1301274621&amp;sr;=8-1&quot;&gt;$137 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How much time can Macros Save?</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/how-much-time-can-macros-save/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-20T19:42:30-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/how-much-time-can-macros-save</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the background of my computer, I’ve been tracking my work lately – at a very low level. How many mouseclicks? How many characters typed? Honestly, sometimes it feels like that’s my job description. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Autohotkey for macros and abbreviations for most of the 3 years I have used e-MDs. I’ve got dozens of macros, and hundreds-to-thousands of abbreviations/typo corrections. How much time does all that macroing save?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My estimates are based on a model of how users generally use computers (Wikipedia: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke-Level_Model&quot;&gt;Keystroke Level Model&lt;/a&gt;). Your mileage will vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-typical-months-worth-of-work&quot;&gt;A typical month’s worth of work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;|Activity|#|Time|
|——-|——–|——–|
|Typing|127K characters|10.6 hours|
|Mouseclicking|32K clicks|9.1 hours|&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;savings&quot;&gt;Savings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Activity&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Typing&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;24K characters.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2 hours&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Mouseclicking&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5K clicks&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.5 hours&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time saved on clicking is probably much more given some macros save 30 seconds. For example, consider labs in order tracking. For planned care visits (checkups, diabetes, hypertension, etc), I have a macro that notes ‘Will discuss…’, signs it off, removes it from ordertracking. Every day I use it a couple times and it saves me about a minute of documentation. Improves my record-keeping, reduces my stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;; Planned Care Lab. Annotes a lab to Discuss, signs, removes from order tracking
^+p::
IfWinActive, Patient Chart
{
click, 915, 150
WinWaitActive, Memo
Sleep, 200
SendInput, Discuss at already scheduled &#39;planned-care&#39; visit.
click, 435, 439
WinWaitActive, Patient Chart
{
sleep, 200
click, 854, 150
sleep, 200
click, 51, 182
sleep 200
click, 70, 259
sleep, 200
Send !fx
}
}
return
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So using my low level data as a family doctor, generally living in e-MDs all day long: I’ve got more than 1 hour straight clicking/typing per typical workday. And Macros/Abbreviations save me about 15% of the typing/clicking. That’s probably my limit because most months are about the same. It’s a local maximum for me. I can write more macros but I won’t get that much improvement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/03/local-maximum.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://52weeksofux.com/post/694598769/the-local-maximum&quot;&gt;Local Maximum&lt;/a&gt; is a key concept. You can only &lt;em&gt;optimize&lt;/em&gt; so far. Sometimes you need to &lt;em&gt;redesign&lt;/em&gt;. This applies macros, or to practice processes or graphic design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So unless the situation changes (say, Meaningful Use changing workflows and adding clicking), I’m only going to get so far with macros and abbreviations. I’ll still use them a lot partly because they work well with my style. But if I really want to get done quicker, I either need to decrease quantity (type and click less), increase speed (probably not going to help much), or change method (Dragon Naturally Speaking, better templates, better delegation, hire a scribe, et cetera.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Charting efficiency in e-MDs</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/charting-efficiency-in-e-mds/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-18T22:25:54-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/charting-efficiency-in-e-mds</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my post about &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/snappy-charting/&quot;&gt;snappy charting&lt;/a&gt; I talked about some of the theories about making charting fast.
Ranging from big to small, here’s the toolset e-MDs provides for efficient charting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;This:&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Does This:&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Shortcut&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Whole template note entered at once including all the hx, exam, orders, billing&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Past Visit&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Copies a whole note from this particular patient&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Pre-Click&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;A template of a note section&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Past Click (Clock)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;A previous note section from a note on this particular patient&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;QuickPick Prescription &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Complete Prescription with all detail &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you look here, there’s a theme of abbreviation. Combine some chunk of clicks/text in a template or note and make it doable in a few clicks. Definitely saves time over doing a whole note from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These should definitely be considered targets for &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/practice-based-evidence/&quot;&gt;Practice-based Evidence&lt;/a&gt; – use the data from your own practice to optimize your practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortcut:&lt;/strong&gt; Report out ICDs by frequency to make sure you have appropriate common shortcuts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preclicks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;preclicks-by-template-or-by-provider&quot;&gt;I have a crystal report of preclicks by user and template&lt;/a&gt;. Allows you to see popular templates for preclick to make sure you’re taking advantage of options that your partners are using&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quickpick:&lt;/strong&gt; Report of Prescriptions by Provider sorted by frequency. Use your top 50 to work through your favorite prescriptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Practice-based Evidence</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/practice-based-evidence/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-18T22:17:40-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/practice-based-evidence</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Evidence-based medicine (EBM) has been a fad in medical training and practice over the last decade. The premise is straightforward: use the best available evidence when making clinical decisions. The gold standard is the randomized double-blind large scale clinical trial. Generally we think of this as the most reliable form of evidence. It’s not perfect (&lt;a href=&quot;http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/287/21/2847.full&quot;&gt;publishing bias&lt;/a&gt; can even effect the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/294/2/218.abstract&quot;&gt;most popular studies&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In training, this seemed pretty simple. I just needed to learn the results of the key clinical trials and then I’d know what to do when I was taking care of patients. Any practicing doc know how naive this is. Though patients are rightly wowed by the night health segment on the news, the reality is that most of what we do is not resultant from gold-standard evidence. Anecdotes and personal experience and expert opinion are more common than we wish they were. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One additional problem (maybe this s sematics) with EBM is the focus on quantitative issues. There’s a bias towards measuring things that are easily measurable or countable. So, LDL get’s measured because it can be. Sometimes studies have patient-oriented evidence (say, heart attack survival) but often there are surrogate markers like the LDL. But how much weight do the studies put on having to take a medicine daily for decades to possibly prevent something? That ‘cost’ to a patient isn’t at all easy to measure. Yet it’s a common and significant barrier to care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, quibbles aside, here’s my addition. Practice-based evidence. With EHRs, we are all generating tons of structured data that we could use to improve care. The goal is to have pervasive reporting to measure what’s actually happening in a practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to take advantage of the quick prescription feature of my EHR. First run a report of you most frequently prescribed medications. That’s Practice-based evidence of where to start. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have some almost expired Humulin insulin. (This happened a couple weeks ago.) Report out people we could give it to. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do we have to all be here the day after Christmas?  Report out your previous Boxing Day schedules, see how many were acute visits, etc. Use the schedule to estimate this year’s demand. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, reporting needs to be much simpler if we’re all going to take advantage of it. Still, how many of us really exploit the built-in reports? Even if the evidence is easy to find, do we use this best available evidence?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to organize MU Benchmarks.</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/how-to-organize-mu-benchmarks/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-07T21:00:35-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/how-to-organize-mu-benchmarks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the main troubles with Meaningful Use (MU) is that there are so many benchmarks. It’s great to have them all (now we have an agreed upon target) but keeping track is a pain. In my practice we’ve got a dozen providers. As it stands now, we’d need to run report after report after report to see where we are. And if we’re not careful, we’d waste hundreds of pages of paper in the process. Just entering all the parameters to run the reports will take real time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ahh, a dashboard&lt;/em&gt;. People think data visualization is about making everything simplify down to just a few key speedometers. Sure, as we get close to compliance, it may be a single “Go, No Go” type metric of do we meet all the intended benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/data-driven-practice/&quot;&gt;Data Driven Practice&lt;/a&gt; at the User Conference, visualization is about making data usable to people. Not just the geeks. Making this visual is really important. Most &lt;a href=&quot;http://mygengo.com/talk/blog/why-your-startup-needs-a-visual-dashboard/&quot;&gt;decent visualizations&lt;/a&gt; will engender much more attention than any table of numbers. Couldn’t it just be a single page of paper?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different organizations will have different ways of organizing. This could be a starting point about how to organize subsets of benchmarks. I’m using my short titles for benchmarks based on my Meaningful Use Map:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/02/MU-measures.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/02/MU-measures-300x224.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;core-versus-optional-and-what-optional-benchmarks-are-you-aiming-for&quot;&gt;Core versus Optional (and what optional benchmarks are you aiming for?)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### By &lt;strong&gt;Eligible Provider&lt;/strong&gt; (all the benchmarks on 1 page)
### Audience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front Office:&lt;/strong&gt; Demographics, Patient List, Patient Reminders, Portal (signup).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Staff:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitals, Allergy List, Medication List, Smoking Status, Medicine Reconciiation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Admin/Records:&lt;/strong&gt; Drug Interactions (turned on), transmit CMS, Electronic Copy, Exchange Clinical Info, Security Audit, RxHub (turned on), Lab Interface, Immunization Registry, Syndromic Surveillance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docs:&lt;/strong&gt; Problem List, Electronic Rx, CPOE, Clinical Decision Support, Clinical Summary, Patient Education, Summary of Care.
### Now vs. Later (What could you already report with older EHR Software?)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now:&lt;/strong&gt; Demographics, Vitals, Problem List, Allergy List, Med List, Electronic Rx, CPOE, Drug Interactions, Clinical Decision Support, RxHub, Lab Interface, Portal,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Needs 7.0:&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking Status, Transmit CMS, Clinical Summary, Electronic Copy, Exchange Clinical Info, Security Audit, Patient List, Patient Reminders, Patient Education, Medicine Reconciliation, Summary of Care, Immunization Registry, Syndromic Surveillance.
### Target Goal&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve Care:&lt;/strong&gt; Demographics, Vitals, Problem List, Allergy List, Med List, Smoking Status, Electronic Rx, CPOE, Drug Interactions, Clinical Decision Support, Transmit CMS, RxHub, Lab Interface, Patient List, Patient Reminders.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health:&lt;/strong&gt; Immunization Registry, Syndromic Surveillance.
### Easy vs Hard Benchmarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dashboards-again&quot;&gt;Dashboards, Again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I imagine is doing each of those bolded targets above on a single page. My group has about a dozen providers and any of those reports ought to be doable without requiring a Microfiche to read the results. Given the 90 day reporting period for 2011, these should default to the last 90 days. And as I’ve said before: the right number of parameters is …. zero. It should be click, go make a cuppa, come back to a fancy printed report that you post on the wall for all to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e-MDs has stated they have a ‘dashboard’ in development. I don’t know which of these approaches it will take but hopefully we’ll see in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Snappy Charting</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/snappy-charting/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-04T15:32:43-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/snappy-charting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This article requires 20+ minutes to read the accompanying materials and videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all these Gigaherz and Gigabytes and stuff, why is charting so slow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have gut awareness of speed. Snappy. Quick. Pop. ….These aren’t really the words people think of when interacting with an EHR. And this isn’t a computing problem (not enough CPU, RAM, Hard Drive, Network or whatever.) This in an interface problem. How do you speed up a process that produces unique products? This is like the difference between homemade chili made with homegrown beans and store-bought. We’re trying to distill a unique visit between a doctor/patient into a unique written record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gets rapidly philosophical. The two sides of how to do this are probably “Narrative Medicine” and “Structured Data.” Narrative medicine champions the uniquness and individuality. It’s typified by voice dictation with all the flavor and information it contains. It’s not canned or vanilla or generic. And Narrative Medicine argues that EHRs are stipping our all our humanity. Structured Data focuses on being able to leverage the tremendous data at our hands to improve care and quality. But if we’re going to report data out (say, who needs a flu shot) you need to have structured data (codes like ICD/CPT/etc). Computers needs codes to do their number crunching. We all hate assigned codes but it’s not going away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap between narrative medicine and structured data is huge and isn’t going away soon. Tech like voice recognition and natural language processing are going to help but don’t count on this getting solved soon. Mapping something like ‘Bob’s back today to talk about his recent sugars’ to ‘Diabetes, Type 2, Requiring Insulin, Uncontrolled’ isn’t that easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So: Better Hardware isn’t going to help. And maybe someday the EHR will know what we mean, but don’t hold your breath. &lt;strong&gt;The way to improve snappiness is to focus on the person.&lt;/strong&gt; So things like usability, user experience, interface bandwidth, typing speed are what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kill-off-hunt-and-peck-typing&quot;&gt;Kill off Hunt and Peck Typing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know anyone who  hunts and pecks? They’ll essentially never get a sense of flow or snappy work. Take a couple hours a week and start practicing. Maybe spend $20 on some Mavis Beacon software but start practicing. Typing without looking at the keyboard is a fundamental requirement of modern EHR use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Does any clinic actually perform typing tests as part of hiring?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;latency-and-bandwidth&quot;&gt;Latency and Bandwidth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To really understand snappiness, we’re going to need some vocabular. Latency and Bandwidth are networking terms. If you’re trying to figure out why ‘the internet is slow today’ you’ll need both. Tidbits probably does the best discription even though it’s pretty old. As you’re reading, you don’t want to get mired. I’m going to be using these ideas of latency and bandwidth as it relates to usability. (Say Interface bandwidth or attention latency)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tidbits.com/article/729&quot;&gt;Bandwidth and Latency: It’s the Latency, Stupid (Part 1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tidbits.com/article/723&quot;&gt;Bandwidth and Latency: It’s the Latency, Stupid (Part 2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead. Go over to Tidbits. I’ll wait for you to come back….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interface-bandwidth-and-latency&quot;&gt;Interface Bandwidth and Latency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A useful theory, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke-Level_Model&quot;&gt;Keystroke Level Model&lt;/a&gt;,  goes back to the early 1980s before the first modern Mac – the first Mac.  Home computers existed before the Mac, but the original Mac is the first computer you (now living in 2011) could sit down in front of it and be comfortable using it. Keystroke Level Model describes how fast a person can get something done on a computer. So when you’re figuring out what’s the fastest way to chart you need to balance clicking and typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you type 50 words a minute, you’re hitting 200 keys a minute. In that same minute, you might be able to point and click 30 or 40 times. So is it faster to type the paragraph or template? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Video, &lt;a href=&quot;http://10gui.com/video/&quot;&gt;10GUI&lt;/a&gt; shows a futuristic interface. The specifics may not be available now but the ideas are still enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s the philosophical basis for why I focus so much on abbreviations and macros. People think I’m crazy to make a macro that saves 4 or 5 clicks. But I’ve got low latency with my hands on the keyboard and pretty decent bandwidth. I can type without looking at the keyboard so I can even do some of this at the same time as I watch a patient’s expression. Mousing has much more latency and requires me to use my attention and vision to find the buttons that I’m going to click. The clicking is much much easier to learn (click on this button) than macros. But assuming an expert user: mousing is actually more work and much slower. It still can be efficient: if a few clicks can add a whole sentence (via a template) it might be faster than typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger the number of unique items, the less well a mouse works. If you have 3000 options (the size of our Orders Template, actually), you don’t want a list. Even an organized list is overwhelming. If a macro can allow it to be done via typing, it could be much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Visit Summary Cleanup (1.0)</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/visit-summary-cleanup-1-0/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-01T21:54:41-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/visit-summary-cleanup-1-0</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At it’s most basic, I’d like to make Visit Summaries usable for patients. This seriously doesn’t work for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Document ID a5946a99-3ebb-44ad-8d6c-7ecbe59b1d11
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By reducing the header, it saves a half a sheet and really simplifies it. It’s still not pretty/legible – reformatting is equally important. But for a few minutes of editing the XSL file, this is a big improvement. Before and after shows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/03/Visit-Summary-1.0.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/03/Visit-Summary-1.0-300x193.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a little bit of css, you  can make something that looks like it’s supposed to be printed. I can use some of that saved space to make the outline more obvious and to increase legibility and scanability. (New word…?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/03/visit-summary-2.1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/03/visit-summary-2.1-300x216.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this sort of makeover is limited to printouts. It won’t clean up the portal version for  patients. It could be done for portal but e-MDs would have to allow it. And given that there doesn’t seem to be any development/changes on portal for several years, I doubt that will happen soon. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: New version 6/17/2011 by Chris. She says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; I took off the word Medicare in the percentage 
 description for Core Criteria #13. Instead of reading 
 &quot;50% of Medicare patients&quot;, it now reads &quot;50% 
 of patients&quot;.  I also added to Menu Set #2 Lab Results
 in EHR as Structured Data that the lab results must 
 be signed off to be counted in the denominator. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar spirit to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/meaningful-use-map-and-kickoff/&quot;&gt;my Meaningful Use Kickoff Presentation&lt;/a&gt;, Christine Hunter, PA, put together 2 summaries of the MU benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two word documents have screenshots (warning: big files!) and explain benchmarks with a practical summary of what it means for a practice. I can imagine printing these out and sitting around with partners to make sure they are clear. Consider it a ‘cliff notes’ to the videos on Supportcenter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

   <title>Macro to add flowsheets in e-MDs</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/macro-to-add-flowsheets-in-e-mds/"/>
   <updated>2011-02-23T14:21:39-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/macro-to-add-flowsheets-in-e-mds</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In our clinic we wanted to use vitals flowsheets but they were turned on in most charts. We have about 15K patients. So if it takes 15 seconds to open a chart and turn it on, you’ve got 62 hours of mindless clicking for someone to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e-MDs has a script (SQL) with this functionality but we couldn’t get it (it’s unofficial/unsupported.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://autohotkey.com&quot;&gt;Autohotkey &lt;/a&gt;to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a brief script to loop through account numbers and do it. I suspect there’s a memory leak in e-MDs because this would repeatedly crash (different ways, slightly different frequency) about every 120 patients. Still, it made the process about 20x faster in hands on time. This does about 10 patients a minute. It could go faster but our e-MDs performance is pretty variable on ‘snappiness’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the source code, and you’d need a file with account numbers (that’d be a separate task, obviously.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DetectHiddenText, Off

; Loop through a list of Account Numbers and turn on vitals flowsheet.

}

&lt;p&gt;We’re all so busy with day to day that’s easy to overlook things. Yearly, the govenment puts out this suumary of health. Hundreds of pages of useful stats. Although Meaningful Use will focus us all on certain measures (and definitely certain PQRI measures, too), here’s a step back at what’s going on in our system. From 1988 to 2008, say, statin use went from 2% to 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report has hundreds of these graphs and is a great brainstorming device – flip through to generate ideas of things you could improve. This definitely calls for an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ipad/&quot;&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreader.net/goodreader.html&quot;&gt;Goodreader&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe a glass of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Meaningful Click for e-MDs</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/meaningful-click/"/>
   <updated>2011-02-08T15:51:38-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/meaningful-click</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With Meaningful Use there will be a lot more clicking in life. Making sure that a patient’s chart is up to date (Problems, Allergies, Medications, etc) is more important than ever. Especially now that patients will be getting copies of their clinical summaries with many visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaningful Click is an app for Docs using e-MDs that accelerates patient chart review. It allows you to tab through a review and updated things quickly with macro goodness. Using the macro makes it less error prone and faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-it-will-do&quot;&gt;What it will do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After starting the macro it will open each section for review with the ‘tab’ key.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Processing through will automatically hit the ‘review’ buttons for each section.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There will probably be some other specific macros like ‘tobacco button’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tabbing-through-the-health-summary&quot;&gt;Tabbing through the Health Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wanna-try-it&quot;&gt;Wanna Try It?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download it to use if you’d  like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dl.dropbox.com/u/607655/meaningfulclick%2003072011.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/57-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Meaningful Click (March 7, 2011)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use ‘Windows Classic Theme’ in XP. I can fix that but it’s pretty low priority to me – I want other features working for me, first. To change your theme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right click on desktop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In themes tab, choose Windows Classic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you download the  .zip above, you’ll find the 3 files, open meaningful click and you’ll see a little green “H” added to the tray in the bottom right of your screen. You don’t have to use the sounds but they really help me focus. I don’t think you’ll find them obtrusive. Once you’re in a chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control-Tab: Starts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tab to go down&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shift-Tab to go up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When Done, it’ll open up Medications Tab (My Fav!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known Issue: This doesn’t open the pregnancy module on the health summary. (By design)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use this about 10x a day already. Really nice to tab though a person’s health summary.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jargon really complicates Meaningful Use discussions. When talking about prescriptions, say, one person might be thinking about the input (CPOE) while another is thinking about transmission (electronic). Or one person talks about clinical decision support while the other hears clinical reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my solution. Print this out huge and put it in your conference room. It’s color-coded by major MU goal (improving care is yellow, engaging patients/families is orange, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Un-Unsigned</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/un-unsigned/"/>

   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/un-unsigned</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Much e-MDs is focused on visits to the doctor. (Chart, Bill, Schedule). But it also  has panel-managment tools like Order Tracking, Refills, Unsigned Notes. These let you at a glance see how your practice is doing overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Un-Unsigned&lt;/strong&gt; is a panel management tool for making sure that you’re signing off the thousands of documents that come your way. It helps you mistake-proof against things being mishandled. It automates flipping through unsigned scans and labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the standard e-MDs report, there are many documents that may never need to be signed off (administrative forms, etc.) And it’s a serious drain on your energy to open up each person’s  account so you can find the document to sign off. On my &lt;strong&gt;Un-Unsigned&lt;/strong&gt;, there’s a custom crystal report (which may need to be customized for your practice). In our practice, the report eliminates many faxes and financial forms, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;installing-un-unsigned&quot;&gt;Installing Un-Unsigned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multi-step instructions included in the zip. Directions assume familiarity with e-MDs and some of the technical bits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;using-un-unsigned&quot;&gt;Using Un-Unsigned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tip: Clear out taskman and order tracking first.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go into e-MDs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hit F5 to collect your unsigned documents (takes about a half minute)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hit F1 for the next document&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning/Using the keyboard shortcuts in the macro will make you quicker over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Known Issue 1&lt;/strong&gt; In my clinic, computers have different installs (say, no Bill) so that causes problems for the macro. Wifi problems can also cause it to crash. I could make it more resilient by slowing it down but that degrades it for me personally since I like having it run quickly. I do have a few partners who use this regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Known Issue 2&lt;/strong&gt; This includes documents assigned to me. But sometimes the reason it is unsigned was that it wasn’t assigned to me. I plan to add a patient-centered report (my patients, documents that are unsigned whether they are mine to sign or not.)&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Prevention Checklist</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/prevention-checklist/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-29T09:50:59-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/prevention-checklist</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s my checklist maker for preventative recommendations in e-MDs. It uses a Word Form, pulls the patients age/sex from the form, and then creates an individualized checklist. So 22yo male will get different recommendations than a 64yo female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this a proof-of-concept as of 5/5/2010. I’m still refining it for my use and hope to eventually parse through the patient’s problem list for secondary prevention recommendations. But it’s working for my use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiiYyGDDSJg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/01/45-movie-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; See it in action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Known Issues:&lt;/strong&gt; On our setup, there’s variable server speed. Usually the first time of the day it crashes. It seems to depend on how word forms are cached. Works reliably for the rest of the day. Unfortunately I’m not debugging our server performance so consider this proof of concept only. I still use it myself. I’ll probably remove the word-form .&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tested on:&lt;/strong&gt; e-MDs 6.32&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>e-MDs Custom Reports</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2011/e-mds-custom-reports/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-29T09:45:44-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/e-mds-custom-reports</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My group started e-MDs in 2008 – we’ve been reasonably impressed overall. But out of the box, e-MDs can’t really deliever on the ‘digital promise’. Once things are bits instead of atoms (say, e-MDs instead of paper charts) it should be easy to slice and dice information in new ways. It’s that slicing of info that really kicks it up a notch: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What diabetics are overdue for an appointment?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which doctors need coding reviews to improve billing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If we make this scheduling change, will our patient continuity improve?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is our appointment access better or worse than this time last year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which referral doctors should we outreach to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using your practice data to inform your decision-making, you make better decisions. Put another way: &lt;em&gt;Measure what matters, manage what you measure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Vanilla’ reports from e-MDs only get you started. They are good for certain cookie-cutter problems. Once you start dreaming of how you could simplify life by having good decisions based on good data, well, you’ll come up short. You need custom reports that focus on what’s important to you. Notice Processor ( and Registry Processor in 7.0) is another way to get started on reporting but also has built-in limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing reporting yourself is possible (Example #1: Me) but requires geeky dedication and insight. This is complex stuff. But a small amount of complicated reporting work makes the rest of practice easier. I think it’s like picking a practice out of residency – if you make that decision right, you can mess up a lot of other things and still be happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/custom-report/&quot;&gt;Let me know if you need help with custom reports.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://unchart.com/2011/well-child-registry-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This report searches visits in the past three years for well child visits. It lists them by patient with the patient’s current age (in months), and their age at each visit (in months again). It makes it quick to see which patients are overdue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I used your well child recall report 2 weeks ago and got some kids back in with it. – Keith Toms, MD”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my clinic of about a dozen providers, this runs about 65 pages long. But it only takes a few minutes to highlight all the patients who need appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Sweeney of Mid State Health re-worked the report to go up to age 17 and to include the ability to export to automated reminder calls. He says: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Anyone is interested I kinda supersized this report
 
 Added Last CPE Date, days since last CPE, expanded
 age range to 0 - 17, 
 
 created an appointment reminders group with first, last, 
 address, city , state, zip, phone, with PCP name this 
 can be exported and uploaded to autodialer,created a 
 mail merge group with first, last, address, city, state, 
 zip this can be used to send reminder letters or postcards,
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Find and textutil</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2006/find-and-textutil/"/>
   <updated>2006-03-06T09:15:26-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2006/find-and-textutil</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently had a huge folder of word documents that I wanted to make into text documents. Unfortunately they were spread in a number of subfolders. Since there were about 36K files, I sure didn’t want to do this manually. (I was going to use these files to setup Dragon Naturally Speaking.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac OS X 10.4 has a function called textutil that allows conversion between different types of files. So what I needed was a way to feed it the name of every file. As it turned out, the solution was relatively short and sweet. This is the power of command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; find . -name *.doc -exec textutil -convert txt &#39;{}&#39; \; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Command:&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;What it does:&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;find&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;a unix command for directory recursion&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;the current folder&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;name *.doc&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;every .doc file&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-exec&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;apply a shell command&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;textutil -convert txt&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;convert it to a text file&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;’{}’&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;the filename from the find command&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;the end of the -exec command above.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining the find command with textutil makes it a power utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; find . -name *.doc -exec rm &#39;{}&#39; \;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can be used afterwards to remove all the .doc files.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Auto-sorting Chart Notes</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2005/auto-sorting-chart-notes/"/>
   <updated>2005-02-01T09:11:49-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2005/auto-sorting-chart-notes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Has this ever happened to you? A patient comes in to tell you about a problem, and, golly, they don’t tell you the story in the order that you want to chart it. The patient tells you some HPI, then mentions a bit of social history, skips to medical history and goes back to the HPI. In one sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this problem to some acquaintances who use &lt;a href=&quot;http://barebones.com&quot;&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt; and one of them whipped out a short &lt;a href=&quot;http://perl.com&quot;&gt;perl&lt;/a&gt; script that auto-sorts the note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty simple, I defined some ‘tags’ that I type to determine what type of information it is. (Actually, I’d use something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://typeit4me.com/&quot;&gt;typeit4me&lt;/a&gt; to make &lt;code&gt;sh&lt;/code&gt; turn into &lt;code&gt;SocHx:&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script assumes that untagged lines go with the previous tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it works. It’s better than an autosorting feature built-in to things like Micorsoft Word because you can easily edit how things will sort. And it only sorts if you tell it to. This is definitely a 5 star idea. I may port this over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; at some time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
my %list = (  
			  &#39;&#39;       =&amp;gt; 0,
			  &#39;CC&#39;    =&amp;gt; 1,
			  &#39;HPI&#39;     =&amp;gt; 2,
			  &#39;ROS&#39;    =&amp;gt; 3,
			  &#39;MedHx&#39;	=&amp;gt; 4,
			  &#39;SurgHx&#39; =&amp;gt; 5,
			  &#39;FamHx&#39; =&amp;gt; 6,
			  &#39;SocHx&#39; =&amp;gt; 7,
			  &#39;DevHx&#39; =&amp;gt; 8,
			  &#39;ObHx&#39; =&amp;gt; 9,
			  &#39;PEX&#39; =&amp;gt; 10,
			  &#39;Dx&#39; =&amp;gt; 11,
			  &#39;Rx&#39; =&amp;gt; 12  
		   );
my $currentState = &#39;&#39;;
my %storage = ();

while (defined (my $line = &amp;lt;&amp;gt;)) {
	chomp( $line);
	if ($line =~ m/^\s*([^\:]*)\:\s*(.*)$/) {
		if (defined $list{$1}) {
			$currentState = $1;
			$line = $2;
			if ($line =~ m/^\s*$/) {
				next;
			}
		}
	}
	
	if (! defined $storage{$currentState}) {
		$storage{$currentState} = [ $line ];
	}
	else {
		push ( @{$storage{$currentState}}, $line);
	}
}

foreach my $key ( sort { $list{$a} &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; $list{$b} } keys %storage) {
	if ($key ne &#39;&#39;) {
		print &quot;\n&quot;, $key, &quot;\n&quot;;
		print &quot;-&quot;x(length $key), &quot;\n&quot;;
	}
	print join( &quot;\n&quot;, @{$storage{$key}}), &quot;\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2011 Update&lt;/em&gt; Dealing with out-of-order information is still a huge problem. All day long I’m flipping back and forth inside the chart. A little better with macros but still a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyhow: I’m reading &lt;em&gt;Google Hacks&lt;/em&gt; by O’reilly and thoght I should record my favorites for future use. These ‘keywords’ allow you to limit searches to useful subsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;link: Pages that link to a particular page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;filetype: Documents like PDF files, or PPT files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;intitle: Pages whose title contain a particular word&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;inurl: Pages like above but in the URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, say you are doing a presentation on hypertension. You could do this search in google to see what powerpoints are on the internet for ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; hypertension filetype:ppt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2011 Update&lt;/em&gt; This trick is still useful and very few people are aware of it. Google-fu is still a skill that is unevenly distributed in the population. Spending some time with the most recent version of ‘Google Hacks’ is still a useful idea.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Charting Efficiency</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2005/charting-efficiency/"/>
   <updated>2005-01-27T06:31:15-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2005/charting-efficiency</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-is-charting-efficiency-so-important&quot;&gt;Why is Charting Efficiency so Important?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve done this business for any amount of time, that seems like a silly question. There is so much work to be done that no doc has time to waste on charting. Everyone develops shortcuts and tricks to  try and save time. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Voice Dictation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paper Templates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mental Templates (so you don’t have to think so hard)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Superbills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Electronic phrases and shortcuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every physician does this to some extent. But there’s a tradeoff. Quicker charting can lead to lesser quality. If you spent more time, you surely could write a more accurate note. Alternatively, automating the ‘boilerplate’ material frees you to spend more effort on the unique part of each encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electronic-medical-chart-efficiency&quot;&gt;Electronic Medical Chart Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic Medical Charts can be much quicker looking up material. When you can resort labs to find a TSH from 2 years ago that can be quicker than flipping through all the old labs of a paper chart. On the other hand, electronic charts can take a lot more time on the front end. Typing a blood pressure into the blood pressure field takes longer than scrawling it onto a sticky note. What if you have to log in to record that blood pressure. There goes more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s run the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Say changing something saves you 5 seconds per visit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A typical primary care doc might have 6,000 or more visits in a year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over the course of a 30 year career you are talking about saving &amp;gt; 50 days of work by saving 5 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that right? 50 workdays! It’s easy to see why people love dictating. But it also emphasizes how ruthless we need to be about efficiency. Any tiny change can really payback over the course of a career. &lt;em&gt;How can I save 5 seconds today?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Better Way to Search the AAFP Site</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reading through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596004478/qid=1076563948//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-5723696-2099150?v=glance&amp;s;=books&amp;n;=507846&quot;&gt;Google Hacks&lt;/a&gt; and thought of a way to search the AAFP website for articles useful to a Family Doctor (the printable PDFs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-i-do-it&quot;&gt;How did I do it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the ‘View Source’ option of your web browser on this page. There are 6 lines of HTML that create the search form. The 4th &amp;amp; 5th lines are the cooking-with-gas part. They limit the otherwise large result from google to only PDF files from the AAFP.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Backup Fundamentals</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2005/backup-fundamentals/"/>
   <updated>2005-01-22T08:30:59-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2005/backup-fundamentals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having an electronic medical chart requires a well coordinated backup strategy. It’s not all that complex – despite what computer professionals will tell you. The basics of backup have not changed in the last decade and they are not likely to change in the next. What changes are the details like what type of media (floppies became Zip Disks became Writeable CDs became Writeable DVDs.) So Here are the fundamentals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automatic:&lt;/em&gt; Backups are too important to require a person to remember. They need to happen without intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Off-Site:&lt;/em&gt; If you building burns down, having a backup is no good. Or if someone attempts identity theft, they might steal all your disks along with your server. Separating the backups physically increases reliability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiple:&lt;/em&gt; You are trying to avoid a single point of failure. That’s the point of backup. It doesn’t do you any good if your hard drive crashes and when you try to restore from backup your only copy doesn’t work. Think of this: Once I had a crash that damaged a paper I was writing. I tried to restore from my floppy (1993!) but the floppy was bad. But I had thought ahead. So I got my backup backup floppy! It was bad too. That’s when I realized that the floppy drive itself was bad. And it had just damaged both copies of my backup. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verified:&lt;/em&gt; The point is being able to restore the data. That needs to be tested. Verification can be easily built-in and it can double how long a backup takes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fresh:&lt;/em&gt; Even if you multiple backups, you should rotate in new backups and save old ones somewhere. You don’t want to have three very old backups only to find out that you had a bad batch of media at the beginning that is affecting them all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frequent:&lt;/em&gt; How much data can you lose and still be OK? If your practice lost a weeks worth of charts would that be fine? I’d guess not. In a medical office setting the record should probably be backed up every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it’s a bit old, Adam Engst wrote a 3 part series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=04917&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=04924&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=04945&quot;&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in 1998 that discusses backup. Again, details have changed but the fundamentals are sound.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fax Popularity (Technology that just won’t die.)</title>
   <link href="http://unchart.com//2005/fax-popularity-technology-that-just-wont-die/"/>
   <updated>2005-01-22T08:28:14-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://unchart.com/2005/fax-popularity-technology-that-just-wont-die</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fax Machine are ‘old-school’. It made sense back when all the documents were paper (read: analog documents.) Nowadays people are taking their digital documents and faxing them through their modems. Seems like a bad idea on the surface – you lose all the benefits of a digtality. Digtal documents don’t take up space and can be easily filed or searched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/articles/03/12/28/2055229.shtml?tid=126&quot;&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; explores why fax technology has not yet died. In particular, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3320515.stm&quot;&gt;BBC Magazine Article&lt;/a&gt; explains some of the reasons why faxing seems to be gaining popularity. There has been a growth of fax-email gateways. That lets people fax straight to e-mail or e-mail straight to fax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big benefits of faxing is its reliability. Sure, fax machines can and do break. But it seems like &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; are more reliable using a fax machine. It’s still too easy for people to accidentally delete e-mail or for someone to ‘lose a file’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching to an all digital approach could be great – documents keep their color and legibility. But there are some analog benefits to fax – it’s so easy sign a fax and fax it back. And that is legally admissable. Getting rid of the fax machine is an eventual goal but currently we are not there yet. People think that technology can replace – that computer faxing replaces fax machine faxing. But really things splinter – faxing just shows up more and more ways.&lt;/p&gt;

  <p>Thanks to Chris O’Grady for pointing this out to me.</p>

<p>Over the years I’ve struggled with Dragon. I think I’ve failed half a dozen times. With honest attempts – where I tried something different to make it work. A newer version. A better microphone. More training. More customized vocabulary. A newer version. A better microphone. etc.</p>

<p><strong>Enunciation still is the key.</strong> </p>

<p>Dictation will never be complete magic for me because I misspeak and slur. But a few years of typing has helped me dicate better – I’m more telegraphic and less rambly.   Within the limits of my enunciation, I thought my setup was working pretty darn well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dragon 11.5 (Not Medical)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/c01u/">Samson C01U</a> microphone on a stand. (Respected for Podcasting. Great bang for buck)</li>
  <li>Custom Vocabulary made from my old dictations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chris takes a different approach: He uses Dragon Medical Version (which costs &gt; $1000) and has a SpeechWare 3-in-1 Microphone (the highest rated table mike.) I prefer a table microphone, like Chris, because I hate taking the headset on and off.</p>

<p>So I decided to buy a <a href="http://www.knowbrainer.com/NewStore/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=402&idcategory;=58">$279 Speechware Mic from Knowbrainer</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/files/2012/06/speechware1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have to say, I was surprised. I recreated a profile (pro tip: Any time you change Dragon Versions, your computer or your microphone, start a new profile. It’s work but it makes sure that each part is being maximized.) And the performance is much better. I still slur certain words but it felt that nearly all of my errors are either slurring or words that aren’t in my custom dictionary.</p>

<p>Now Dragon 12  is out with better accuracy. I’m using some of my Meaningful Use money to optimize my Dragon setup. A newer computer (mine’s pushing 5 years old) and newer Dragon, I’m hoping this will really rock….</p>

<p>I’d recommend the Speechware TableMike for Docs using Dragon daily. </p>

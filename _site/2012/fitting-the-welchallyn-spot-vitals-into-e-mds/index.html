  <span class="post-date">07 Sep 2012</span>
  <p><img src="/files/2011/08/450x0-E1-2-150x150.jpg" alt="" /> After I attested for 2011 Meaningful Use, my group decided to have the doc decide on some of the ‘re-investments’ in our practice. The second thing I got was the WelchAllyn SpotVitals Lxi. (Bigger monitors for reception was first.) I had been interested in this for at least a couple years. A while back, I posted a <a href="http://unchart.com/2012/welchallyn-spotvitals-lxi/">video on using the SpotVitals</a>.</p>

<p>Automated vitals addresses a few different issues for my practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using an interface eliminates typo errors (which can cause embarrassing mistakes graphing, say, weight.)</li>
  <li>By checking blood pressure on the way up, the SpotVitals is faster.</li>
  <li>By speeding up vitals it can allow the nurse/MA to focus more on the person</li>
  <li>Clinical Research shows that labile blood pressure readings are improved with automatic vitals over manual vitals.</li>
  <li>Reduces inter-staff variability in blood pressures.</li>
  <li>By having a central station, it’s much better stocked (every single cuff size is handy, no having to walk for a thigh cuff.)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, sweet, right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, reality hasn’t quite worked that way. The SpotVitals is expensive so you don’t just order one per nurse. We got our first one (without O2 Sat) for about $1700. It’s an extra $1300 to add O2 Sat. WelchAllyn’s milking this, if you ask me. The price is off by an order of magnitude. This is the <a href="http://unchart.com/2011/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitor-wheres-innovation/">same problem with Welch-Allyn’s Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor.</a></p>

<p>e-MDs has an interface – that’s why we bought this specific mdoel. <em>It’s supported.</em> But it’s not really. The interface is a hack outside of e-MDs.It adds enough friction to eliminate the usefulness. The process is: Open Interface, Find Pt, Get Vitals, Close Interface, Open e-MDs, Find Pt, Drop in vitals. If the interface was within e-MDs you could cut the number of steps in half. And although documentation says the interface also works with compatible scales, it’s been broken for a few years according several users. (Thanks Keith for saving me money on a wasted scale!)</p>

<p>Since the machine is expensive, we’ve been re-working clinical processes. Lately we’ve been trying doing vitals out in the waiting room. There are some communication issues between staff. On our next pilot, we’re going to add a few ‘rooms’ to our clinic dashboard. There will be ‘Vitals-Room’ and ‘Vitals Done’ so clinical staff can tell where a pt is in the process (and if there’s a backup, they can route around it.) My goal has been to help my staff decide what they want (not tell them.) So we’re still trying different things out.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/files/2012/09/vitalsbackground-300x185.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since the interface doesn’t work for efficient workflow, I’m building a new ‘pseudo-interface’. This will pop up from within a patient’s chart in e-MDs. I’m working with my staff to figure out the best place to put this. I’m trying a couple different things to make this work. First, much larger font-size so they can see typos better. The left side of this maps to where the vitals are on the machine. (Faster for staff, less cognitive-load so less error prone.) Tabbing through fields works in the order that they work (Again, faster). The results will be put into e-MDs where there’s full details – for example, which arm for the blood pressure. So we simplify input for reliability. </p>

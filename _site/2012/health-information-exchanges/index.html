  <p>I’ll be helping min-ns.org to set up our local HIE. As part of that, I’ve been focusing on the message for doctors about Health Information Exchanges (and Meaningful Use and EHRs). I’m especially proud of my video about what a HIE is – I humbly submit this is the best video on the Internet about that topic. :-)</p>

<h2 id="why-connect">Why Connect?</h2>

<p>MIN-NS: Medical Information Network-North Sound<br />
HIE: Health Information Exchange  </p>

<p>MIN-NS helps doctors unify our medical community for better care.</p>

<h3 id="take-control-of-your-patients-care-team">Take Control of your Patient’s Care Team</h3>

<p>Patients think we are always know what’s going on at other doctors offices or at the hospital. They tell us “I told them to send your the records.” It’s not that simple. There are processes and hurdles – like HIPAA. A doctor can’t just email a colleague. It has to be secure end-to-end. With MIN-NS, a single secure network can connect our whole medical community. Secure email with hospitalists or consultants or referral docs. MIN-NS will aggregate data from different doctors so we can all stay in the loop for a complicated patient. </p>

<h3 id="expand-our-reach">Expand Our Reach</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to have conversations with our colleagues.</li>
  <li>It costs less because it allows direct connections without staff/medical records overhead.</li>
  <li>Up to date lab results from other doctors’ practices</li>
  <li>Get access to ER records without having to call and wait for a fax. (And hope it arrives while the patient is still here.)</li>
  <li>Simplify HIPAA/Privacy concerns by having a <strong>single legal agreement</strong> to connect our local medical community together. That includes SVH, UGH, and Island Hospital. That includes private practices. Having a single agreement means we don’t have to drown in paperwork to innovate and improve our care.</li>
  <li>Be ready to provide informed care the first time a new patient walks into your urgent care.</li>
  <li>Automatically get a discharge summary – no matter which of the local hospitals your patient went to.</li>
  <li>We’ve all got personal priorities. Customize and filter the views of your patient’s data to fit what you need most.</li>
  <li>Achieve <em>Meaningful Use</em> by satisfying the core requirement to exchange <em>key</em> clinical data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-a-hie">What’s a HIE?</h2>

<p>Besides unifying our medical community, a Health Information Exchange (HIE) is an electronic network for securely sharing patient information. It includes secure addition, maintenance, storage and delivery of health records. It focuses on uniquely identifying patients. Obviously it has security regulations like HIPAA and HITECH baked in. Unlike an individual electronic health records system (EHR) of, say, a private doctor, the HIE aggregates information across different systems and EHRs. </p>

<p>The HIE creates a comprehensive record that all of the subscribing healthcare providers can use. Subscribers can access records of individual lab results, consulting reports, and summaries of care. Subscribers can also have the system consolidate the records into a summary that includes information from all the various EHRs and various doctors involved in the patient’s care. The Documents can be viewed online, printed, downloaded, or imported straight into an EHR.</p>

<p>The MIN-NS health information exchange is bringing together hospitals, physicians and other medical service providers. It’s a first step that will later connect us to doctors across Washington State and eventually across the country.</p>

<h2 id="why-now">Why Now?</h2>

<p><em>Meaningful Use</em> is the kickstarter for creating a HIE. In the 2009 Recovery Act, the government created a stimulus to encourage doctors and hospitals to start using electronic health records (EHRs). In particular, the CMS and Medicaid programs are encouraging “Meaningful Use” of EHRs to improve care, engage patients in their care, and improve care coordination. </p>

<p>There are 15 required items to show Meaningful Use – one of which is the ability to interchange key clinical data (like via MIN-NS). Meaningful Use is real: local docs have already received checks for $18,000 for doing Stage 1 Meaningful Use in 2011. Over the next few years, proactive docs could receive a total of $44,000 from Medicare or $63,750 from Medicaid. </p>

<h3 id="procrastinating-is-going-to-hurt">Procrastinating is going to hurt.</h3>

<p>If you don’t think the stimulus matters, be careful. There’s a carrot/stick going on with Meaningful Use. In a few years, CMS and Medicaid will start penalizing providers who can’t show Meaningful Use. And as years go by, the penalities will get bigger and bigger.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-it-all-work">How does it all work?</h3>

<p>Meaningful Use provides benchmarks for measuring a modern EHR.  Modern EHRs capture structured data about care so that we can use it to improve care, reduce health care disparities and exchange information. The MIN-NS HIE coupled with a certified EHR will meet all stage one criteria as defined in
the final rule published by CMS. Secure sharing is central to Meaningful use. By having data distribution and integration, we can avoid difficult and expensive point-to-point intregrations. As Meaningful Use evolves into Stage 2 in 2014 and Stage 3 afterwards, MIN-NS will provide additional functionality to keep our HIE compliant.</p>

  <p>First, some background. A few days ago, the AAFP released a <a href="http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/membership/initiatives/nps/patientcare/changing.html">statement against expanding roles for Nurse Practitioners</a>. The tagline: <em>Ensuring a quality, physician-led team for every patient.</em> </p>

<p><a href="/files/2012/09/PCMH-AAFPInfographic.pdf"><img src="/files/2011/01/17-bar-chart.png" alt="" /> One Page AAFP Infographic</a></p>

<p>Nurse practitioners have started to respond. CKRN wrote about <a href="http://ckrn.tumblr.com/post/31940128969/nurse-practitioners-scope-of-practice-and-turf">Nurse Practitioners, Scope of Practice and turf.</a> (Go ahead and read it, I’ll wait here. )</p>

<p>Dr Berstein says <a href="http://futureoffamilymedicine.blogspot.com/2012/09/patients-are-real-leaders-in-patient.html?m=0">Patients should lead care</a>.</p>

<h3 id="medical-management--team-leadership">Medical management ≠ Team Leadership</h3>

<p>I think these discussions are confusing leadership and management. In the last 100 years since the Flexner Report, physicians have assumed leadership of much of healthcare. Nearly all physicians can get leadership roles if they are willing to commit time/energy.That’s a correlation, though. It’s not that medical school and residency trained us in team leadership. </p>

<p>The AAFP says, “Doctors bring broader and deeper expertise to the diagnosis and treatment of all health problems. Doctors are trained to provide complex diagnoses and develop comprehensive plans to treat them.” That’s technically true compared to Nurse Practitioners. But that’s confusing management of medical care and leadership of patient-centered care. (This is where I like Dr. Bernstein’s idea that patients should be leading – they should be the best advocates.)</p>

<p>Correlation is not causation. Physician training did not make me a team leader. The talents/skills/activities that helped me get into Stanford for college or ETSU for medical school are the foundations for being a leader now. Nearly everything I’ve learned about teamwork or leadership has happened outside of my formal medical education. I learned as a Peace Corps Volunteer or as a volunteer coordinator. In three years of residency I had lectures about practice management. But it was a tacked-on experience  – we weren’t really going to get to practice any of those topics on the current residency clinic. (Who’s going to let a resident decide budgeting priorities?)</p>

<p>We don’t really need that much ‘leadership’. It’s ridiculously simple to see failure across modern healthcare. Healthcare teams need skills at getting things done for patients. Expanding roles for Nurse Practitioners is a non-sequitir for me. It’s unrelated to whether teams are well-run or not. Just like being a physician-owner is unrelated to whether a clinic’s business is efficient. Some are. Some aren’t.</p>

<p>So personally, this feels like protectionism and whining from the AAFP. Let’s provide exceptional care. Let’s keep advocating for innovation and limit the flaws of modern healthcare. If we excel, patients will choose with their feet. There’s more than one way to do things right — I respect Nurse Practitioners’ for trying to create their own way of patient-centered medical care. </p>

<h4 id="postscript">Postscript</h4>

<p>In the 1990s, I heard what I thought was a <em>damning condemnation</em> of the AMA and physicians in general. OK, this is unsourced. But in all the discussion of 1990s Health Care Reform, not a single statement from the AMA was about patient-centered issues. It was all about physician reimbursement. Protecting physician rights, etc. All about protecting turf. Hmm, why am I remembering this anecdote now?</p>

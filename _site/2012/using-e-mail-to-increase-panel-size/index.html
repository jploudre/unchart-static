  <h1 class="post-title">Using e-mail to increase panel size</h1>
  <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2012</span>
  <p>After doing some practice innovations (<a href="http://unchart.com/2012/group-visit-invitation/">group visits are restarting</a>, I’m <a href="http://unchart.com/?s=abpm">undiagnosing patients from hypertension treatment with my ABPM</a>) I may have some availability in my practice without affecting my <a href="http://unchart.com/2011/continuity-report/">continuity</a>.</p>

<p>That means I can potentially increase my panel size a bit and still provide similar care.</p>

<p>I’ve just done a little free within-my-practice advertising and wanted to share what I learned.</p>

<h2 id="mailchimp">Mailchimp</h2>

<p>First, <strong>Don’t do email lists yourself</strong>. This is a <em>solved problem</em> that can be done much better than doing it yourself. I love Mailchimp. The free plan is way more than I need. If you ever need to do this on a larger practice basis (more frequent, more providers), it would scale just fine. </p>

<p>(I don’t imagine anyone will ever use this ‘Spreading Monkey Love’ and I don’t really need credits since I use the free account. But here’s my referral code.)<br />
<a href="http://eepurl.com/k0gpf"><img src="/files/2012/04/MC_MonkeyReward_05.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>With MailChimp you get tools that allow you to automatically do things right:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Include unsubscribe and other bits that make this not spam.</li>
  <li>Automatic removal of bounced emails from the list.</li>
  <li>free templates (Pick the stethoscope one. Bang, you’re done.)</li>
  <li><strong>Awesome analytics</strong>…</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-does-a-lil-panel-campaign-look-like">What does a lil panel campaign look like?</h2>

<p>My clinic started collected addresses more seriously about 18 months ago (when we started Portal to get ready for Meaningful Use.) That’s a relatively recent/fresh list of emails. Call it about 1/3 of my panel.</p>

<p>I used a crystal report to generate a list of ~650 patients. After importing to MailChimp, this was cleaned up to 637.</p>

<ul>
  <li>637 Sent</li>
  <li>62 bounced messages (auto-removed from the list)</li>
  <li>306 Opened</li>
  <li>201 Opened within first 8 hours, sent at noon. </li>
  <li>269 Unopened after a couple weeks.</li>
  <li>1 patient sent me a custom card with the picture of me/Becca</li>
  <li><em>0 Unsubscribes</em> (after a specific call to action to unsubscribe!)</li>
  <li>4 People Verbally asked me about it in 2 weeks</li>
  <li>5 New patients have established in the last 2 weeks (and each one mentioned the email when asked.) And I know of 2 more patients who will be establishing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the first 2 days of opens:</p>

<p>I wanted this email to be personal (vs. corporate) so I included a picture of me with one of my daughters. I aimed the ‘voice’ as being from me, not my clinic. I also wrote the text for simplicity (<a href="http://unchart.com/?s=readability">low reading level is a theme on unchart</a>….)  It looks partly like this:</p>

<p><img src="/files/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-16-at-10.27.46-PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My text:</p>

<hr />
<p>Howdy!</p>

<p>When someone recommends me to a family member or friend, it’s one of my biggest compliments.</p>

<p>My practice has been closed for a few years. I want to be available when you need me. I’ve been accepting family members but sometimes it gets confusing when you talk to my receptionists.</p>

<p>I’m opening my practice again temporarily. If you know someone who needs a family physician, would you recommend they make an appointment with me. Give us a call at (360) 428-1700.</p>

<p>(I hate spam as much as anyone! If you feel it’s inappropriate for me to email, click the unsubscribe link in the message. I’ll be tracking
that….)</p>

<p>– Jonathan Ploudre, MD.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>One mistake</strong>: Open/Closed is jargon. My manager caught that but I had sent it before I got a second pair of eyes. It’s confused some people but I guess I’m thinking all publicity is good publicity.</p>

<p><strong>Another mistake</strong>: This needed to be more carefully proofed.</p>

<p><strong>Third mistake</strong>: I might have considered making this ‘likable’ for facebook. If 2% on the list had liked this on facebook, it may have doubled the exposure. I don’t need to get the word out super-fast but it would have been easy to do and probably would have increased the number of new patients. Who knows?</p>

<p>That said: In 2 weeks, I’ve added 5 patients who were personally recommended to me by people I know. These have been fun because each person is also an embedded compliment from a patient. And having a connection is great for getting to know people. My guess is that this will end up with 10 new patients (people will forget this pretty quickly.) Not bad for a few minutes of work and no money spent. And it’s building community.</p>

  <h1 class="post-title">Visit Summary 7.2.1</h1>
  <span class="post-date">14 May 2012</span>
  <p>It’s been just over a year since I was appalled at the default Visit Summary.</p>

<p>The original visit summary disengages a patient in her care. It sets up barriers like 3/4 of a page of junk before the actual content begins.</p>

<p>So that night as a proof of concept, I <a href="/2011/visit-summary-cleanup-1-0/">cleaned up the Visit Summary</a>. I started using this for my own personal summaries by redirecting e-MDs stylesheet to my own. </p>

<p>If I wanted to share this with other people, I had to set up a webserver. So a month later I set up my <a href="/unchart-visit-summary/">Unchart Visit Summary</a>. Initially I required payments to get the installation instructions. Mostly because I didn’t want to start doing a bunch of tech support. Much to my surprise, some people actually paid me. After a few months, I had gotten enough help to pay my server costs that I made donation optional.</p>

<p>After one of my brief downtimes, I also set up directions for <a href="/2011/visit-summary-self-hosting/">self-hosting the summary</a> for people who didn’t want to rely on a server they didn’t control. Over the last year I got 99% uptime. Which is kinda lousy but I learned a lot. I’ve now got a 15 step server upgrade process. And I’ve accumulated several testing procedures to limit errors. I think I may get 99.95% this year.</p>

<p>So now that I’ve finished my adjustments for 7.2.1 (and e-MDs has made a redesign of their initial summary), where are we at?</p>

<h3 id="major-improvements-from-e-mds">Major improvements from e-MDs</h3>

<p>The best improvements from e-MDs center on making the information more approachable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reordered problems so names came before ICD codes</li>
  <li>Cleaned up med list info (No RxNorm Codes, etc)</li>
  <li>Reduced visual complexity by turning tables into lists.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="main-ongoing-problems-from-e-mds">Main Ongoing problems from e-MDs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Legibility (10 point san-serif font)</li>
  <li>They use background colors for bars but these don’t print right (instead get boxes).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="main-improvements-from-unchart-summary">Main improvements from Unchart Summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Headline and text fonts</li>
  <li>Larger 12 point font size to increase readability</li>
  <li>More specific use of white space to direct attention. </li>
  <li>Cleaner appearance. </li>
  <li>Removal of HPI (now an option from e-MDs) allows more visit summaries to be available at the visit (with an incomplete note.)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Last year in March, the FDA fired a warning shot about the increased risks with the 80 mg dose of simvastatin.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm205215.htm">FDA Warning, March 2010</a></p>

<p>So last year at the e-MDs user conference I used that as an example of <a href="/2011/data-driven-practice/">how to do a quick and dirty report from crystal</a> see the video of how  to do that report in 2 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm256581.htm">Yesterday, the FDA strengthened the recommendation</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not start new patients at the 80-mg dose;</li>
  <li>Continue patients at the 80-mg level only if they have been on the drug for 12 months or longer and have not shown signs of myopathy (the risks for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are greatest in the first year of therapy);</li>
  <li>use other treatments if patients’ LDL targets aren’t met with the 40-mg simvastatin dose.</li>
</ul>

<p>To which, I would add that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Studies on potency say going from 40 to 80mg changes average reduction of LDL from 40 to 46%. (No change, if you ask me.)</li>
  <li>There are decent studies suggesting that on a panel basis you might get much better cardiovascular risk reduction by focusing on adherence (length of prescription, lower co-pay by using generic medication, sychronizing prescriptions to reduce pharmacy visits, strategizing on ways to reduce forgetting, tracking adherence to recall patients who self-discontinue, exploring patient willingness and understanding of treatment.)</li>
  <li>One of my favorites: Given a $20 copay and limits to 30 day supply, how many people are still taking their statin 4 years later? <strong>About 5%</strong> [J GEN INTERNAL MED 2004, 19:638-645</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="simvastatin-report">Simvastatin Report</h3>

<p>This is a simple report that organizes by Provider and then Patient taking 80mg Dose of Simvastatin for e-MDs. This is a quick-n-dirty report. It doesn’t validate things like having a Sig of 1/2 tablet by mouth daily or pay attention to date (it was a couple years ago). I still think it’s  useful caulk – it fills a gap of finding patients by dose of a specific medication which can’t be done with built-in tools.</p>

<p><strong>Philosopical Interlude:</strong> reporting/analytics isn’t a tech issue. This is sociopolitical. Who’s going to run it? Who’s going to contact patients? Or are you going to contact patients? What would you say or plan? Don’t just download this. Decide what you think is best then use this to help make it happen.</p>

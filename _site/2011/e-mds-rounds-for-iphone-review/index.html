In 1998 when I started Medical School, I was the only person in my entire school to have a PDA – a Palm Pilot. At first it seemed like a toy to my classmates. But soon it became an unfair advantage. In my pocket I had info about essentially every drug, every disease, every lab test. It was my ‘external brain’. I thought that someday every doc would have one of these. But I didn’t expect how soon it would be. In second year, my best friend got his Palm Pilot. In third year, about 30 classmates got them. Nowadays essentially every student I meet uses tech as a key part of doctoring whether it’s smartphones or websites like UpToDate. Books still exist. But my ‘odd behavior’ 13 years ago with my Palm is now totally mainstream and unconscious.</p>

<p>People have been asking about e-MDs on the iPhone for years. It’s finally here. I admit I had some trepidation when I heard that e-MDs was developing for the iPhone. Solution Series is powerful and flexible. It’s an award-winning complete package. But usability really lags. Bugs and stability issues are still a daily occurrence. There have been recent new products (OB module, I’m looking at you) that were significantly misconceived. So what will e-MDs Rounds bring? Award-winning or daily frustration?</p>

<p>As an aside, let’s talk about how to judge iPhone software. Mobile use is totally different than sitting down in front of a computer. Trying to shoehorn in a complete desktop experience into a small screen operated with a stubby finger is a recipe for disaster. Sure, I’ve played with e-MDs on a remote desktop app on the iPhone. But no one’s ever going to really make that work. Reducing friction makes mobile apps better. I think <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/11/iphone_likeness">John Gruber</a> nails what makes a good iPhone app:</p>

<pre><code> Figure out the absolute least you need 
 to do to implement the idea, do just that, 
 and then polish the hell out of the experience.
</code></pre>

<p>So my trepidation was that e-MDs wouldn’t ‘get it’ when it comes to making great iOS software.</p>

<h2 id="going-for-rounds-with-rounds">Going for rounds with Rounds</h2>

<p>Before you start using e-MDs rounds, you have to login. Simple, right? Unfortunately not. When Rounds locks (switch away with the Home Button or Multitask), it loses whatever you were doing.  Partially typed message – gone. If you decide to look something up on UpToDate while reviewing a chart – when you log back in, you have to drill back down to the chart again. Rounds doesn’t lock at power-off so the security isn’t as tight as it could be. By enabling Quick ID, they could make login much quicker.</p>

<p>e-MDs Rounds on the iPhone has four major sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Schedule  (for reviewing, not adding)</li>
  <li>Patient Chart</li>
  <li>Messaging (read: Taskman)</li>
  <li>Refills – I couldn’t test this on the example database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Schedule is an obvious fit for mobility – when do I need to be back from the hospital? How free am I next Monday? Schedule can show a day with appointment details (who, when, visit reason) or an overview of the week. Schedule is read-only – not for mobile scheduling of appointments. I think that’s an appropriate simplification. This app is aimed at mobile docs, not mobile receptionists.</p>

<p>Although Schedule works, it is definitely frustrating. Every time you log in, you have to search for your schedule again. It doesn’t remember what you were looking at – it really slows down a quick lookup. There’s a time interval button that doesn’t really reformat your schedule - just changes tickmarks. If you tap on the date to change it, nothing happens. You need to go back to the schedule search. The other sections include an app navigation bar (like at the bottom of iPod App or App Store.) But when you use it to switch to schedule, it disappears.</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_886”  width=”320” caption=”Schedule doesn’t use the navigation bar on the bottom. This could be re-designed to be consistent with the rest of the App.”]<img src="/files/2011/08/photo.png" alt="" />[/caption]</p>

<p>E-mail has long been a staple of smartphones. No wonder it’s a key part of e-MDs rounds.  None of the data is stored on your iPhone (the app is a window into your database). So e-MDs Rounds is HIPAA-compliant. <strong>This is big.</strong> Almost certainly if you’ve been doing any patient-related work with your phone you’ve not been compliant. With more security focus in Meaningful Use and the HITECH Law you can reduce your risk of a breach.</p>

<p>Messaging is more functional than you might imagine. Attached Docman scans? View them on the phone. Attached Chart or Log Note. Ditto. I think secure mobile messaging will soon be taken for granted because it will be so obviously useful to doctors.</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_893” align=”alignnone” width=”320” caption=”You might think you tap in the space by the To: since that’s what you’d do in Mail. Instead you use the icons on the right. Tap on Subject it scrolls off the screen so you can’t see what you’re writing.”]<img src="/files/2011/08/photo-4.png" alt="" />[/caption]</p>

<p>Unfortunately, messaging isn’t bug-free or speedy. Selecting a recipient involves scrolling a long list instead of using autocomplete (which you’d assume using most iPhone software.) And the buttons off to the side for selecting are not intuitive – you would assume you could type into the field where the address goes. When typing a subject, the line scrolls off screen so you can’t see what you’re typing. e-MDs Rounds allows attaching multiple documents – something I’ve not seen in Solution Series. Overall, it adds a layer to viewing/attaching attachments. It’d be quicker if only single attachments were supported.</p>

<p>But these attachments show the biggest strength of e-MDs Rounds: The Patient’s Chart. All of the usual suspects are here:  Health Summary, Visit Notes, Documents, Chronology, Flowsheets. Even Rules is here. I can only assume having Rules is from concurrent development of the iPad version – access to viewing rules doesn’t make much sense in a mobile context.</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_884” width=”320” caption=”Mobile Health Summary is definitely useful for rounding or doing H&amp;Ps.; You can edit the first three on the fly, the others are review-only.”]<img src="/files/2011/08/photo-2.png" alt="" />[/caption]</p>

<p>Health Summary is particularly useful. You can review or update problems, allergies and medications. The various histories are read-only. I couldn’t test it but adding/sending a prescription is clearly intended. Heath Summary has some inconsistencies, though. Stopping an allergy/problem/medication has three different icons. The chart navigation bar shifts up and down as you navigate (it should be stable above the section title.) Even with those problems, e-MDs Rounds packs a lot of power and information onto a little screen.</p>

<p>Visit Notes has a little surprise – you can start a mobile visit note. This could be a boon for charge capture at nursing home rounds or home visit. I’ve never used the Pocket PC Charge Capture tool from e-MDs so I don’t know how it compares. Reading visit notes is easy. Log notes are a little more buried – you have to find them in chronology. But most of the time, you’ll probably have log notes attached so it makes sense not to give Log Notes it’s own section like in Solution Series. It’d be nice to create a log note.</p>

<p>Given all the usefulness hidden in a patient’s chart it’s a shame how difficult it is to look up a patient. One of the major timesavers in Solution Series is the ‘Comma Lookup’. So “Pl,J” gets you to “Ploudre, Jonathan” quickly. On a smaller screen with a software keyboard, that type of abbreviation is even more important. Unfortunately it’s not in Rounds. When you open to patients it defaults to a list rather than the more sensible patient search. When you do search, there’s options like searching by address. To me that’s very unlikely and shows a lack of focusing on mobile use.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>e-MDs Rounds is boutique software – by my guess, they are probably aiming for hundreds of users. This will never beat Angry Birds to the top of the charts on the App Store. I don’t have firm pricing information but I’ve heard it’s about $35/month. So around $400 for a year. For a first try, e-MDs Rounds shows that e-MDs is thinking big – it provides access to most of Chart. One can only wonder where they are on an iPad version of the software.</p>

<p>In many ways, I fear e-MDs Rounds will end up like Solution Series – powerful but frustrating. It’s much slower to use by not having usability features like autocomplete or maintaining where you were when you log back in. This friction makes it less useful on rounds or call. Speed of use is particularly important on a mobile phone where user input is slower than on a desktop. It will be interesting to see how development progresses – will they spend more energy on adding features or on polishing the ones they have? There’s a broad foundation here, with focus on usability and polishing the experience this could be amazing. For now, it’s just a hint at the future.</p>

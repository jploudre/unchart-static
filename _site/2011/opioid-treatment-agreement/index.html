  <h3 id="treatment-agreement">Treatment Agreement</h3>

<p>I am being prescribed “controlled medications”. These may relieve pain but could cause overdose or become habit forming.  It is my doctor’s duty to make sure these medications are being used as safely as possible and as intended.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I will ask for refills only from my primary doctor. I will use only one pharmacy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will take my medications only as prescribed.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not share them or sell them to anyone. I will safeguard prescriptions. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not abuse alcohol, recreational or illegal drugs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My doctor may check on me by calling pharmacies or doing drug tests. My doctor may discuss my medications with my other providers. Other providers may also report violations back to my personal doctor. My doctor could even contact the authorities if illegal activities are suspected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My refills may take 3 working days and might require an office visit. I will  not request refills after hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not seek pain medications from the ER or Urgent Care unless there is a new, acute problem. Then I will only get a small supply until I can see my primary doctor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My doctor may not replace lost or stolen prescriptions. My doctor may not refill medications early if I run out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may be dismissed from the clinic or have my medications stopped if there is a major problem. Major problems include abnormal drug test results, abusive behavior toward staff, selling medications or forging a prescription.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>This is my rework of my current treatment agreement. This would work with the new Washington State Pain Mangement Law (See my <a href="/opioid/">Oploid Page </a>for related bits). </p>

<p>Stats on this treatment agreement are pretty good: Takes <strong>1 and 1/4 minutes to read</strong>. <em>8th grade reading level.</em> </p>

<h3 id="simplifying-forms">Simplifying forms</h3>

<p>I definitely believe in simplifying jargon. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/alan_siegel_let_s_simplify_legal_jargon.html">Alan Siegel’s Ted Talk</a> should be required viewing anytime anyone makes a form. (If you’ve never seen it, it’s probably the most interesting 5 minutes of video you’ll come across today.) Personally, I can’t write something and polish it’s simplicity at the same time. I reserve this type of polishing for forms that thousands of people might see.  It’s easy to forget that not all of our patients have post-graduate degrees.</p>

<p>My general approach to simplifying is to use an <a href="http://www.addedbytes.com/lab/readability-score/">online readability score tool</a>. I will save the initial results of the scores. <em>Then I iterate.</em> Common iterations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cut unnecessary things.</li>
  <li>Eliminate duplicate ideas (or elaborating ideas).</li>
  <li>Break long sentences into a couple shorter sentences.</li>
  <li>Replace longer words with shorter synonyms.</li>
  <li>Try to make it more like a verbal conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I make edits, every few minutes, I’ll reprocess it through the readability tool. I’m tracking to see if I can decrease word count, syllables/word, sentence length and the various readability scores. With a normal legalish clinic document, the first few minutes give the biggest improvements. Deleting sentences or paragraphs can really improve the readability. I’ll probably end up going through the document 3 or 4 times completely. Around then, I’m usually getting pretty much the same results with any tweaks and there don’t seem to be obvious improvements. So a one page form might take 30 - 45 minutes to simplify. </p>

<p>When I did this on <a href="/2011/hipaa-form/">our HIPAA form</a> it was transformative. This was a form that every patient was going to have to fill out. Our old form confused patients and several patients a day would still have the form coming back to the exam room because they hadn’t figured it out. Overnight the reworked for eliminated a lot of patient questions and saved everybody time on a necessary but boring task.</p>

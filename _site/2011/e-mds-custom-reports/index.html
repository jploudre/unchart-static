  <p>My group started e-MDs in 2008 – we’ve been reasonably impressed overall. But out of the box, e-MDs can’t really deliever on the ‘digital promise’. Once things are bits instead of atoms (say, e-MDs instead of paper charts) it should be easy to slice and dice information in new ways. It’s that slicing of info that really kicks it up a notch: </p>

<ul>
  <li>What diabetics are overdue for an appointment?</li>
  <li>Which doctors need coding reviews to improve billing?</li>
  <li>If we make this scheduling change, will our patient continuity improve?</li>
  <li>Is our appointment access better or worse than this time last year?</li>
  <li>Which referral doctors should we outreach to?</li>
</ul>

<p>By using your practice data to inform your decision-making, you make better decisions. Put another way: <em>Measure what matters, manage what you measure.</em></p>

<p>‘Vanilla’ reports from e-MDs only get you started. They are good for certain cookie-cutter problems. Once you start dreaming of how you could simplify life by having good decisions based on good data, well, you’ll come up short. You need custom reports that focus on what’s important to you. Notice Processor ( and Registry Processor in 7.0) is another way to get started on reporting but also has built-in limits.</p>

<p>Doing reporting yourself is possible (Example #1: Me) but requires geeky dedication and insight. This is complex stuff. But a small amount of complicated reporting work makes the rest of practice easier. I think it’s like picking a practice out of residency – if you make that decision right, you can mess up a lot of other things and still be happy. </p>

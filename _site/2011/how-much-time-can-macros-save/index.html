  <h1 class="post-title">How much time can Macros Save?</h1>
  <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2011</span>
  <p>In the background of my computer, I’ve been tracking my work lately – at a very low level. How many mouseclicks? How many characters typed? Honestly, sometimes it feels like that’s my job description. </p>

<p>I’ve been using Autohotkey for macros and abbreviations for most of the 3 years I have used e-MDs. I’ve got dozens of macros, and hundreds-to-thousands of abbreviations/typo corrections. How much time does all that macroing save?</p>

<p>My estimates are based on a model of how users generally use computers (Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke-Level_Model">Keystroke Level Model</a>). Your mileage will vary.</p>

<h3 id="a-typical-months-worth-of-work">A typical month’s worth of work</h3>
<p>|Activity|#|Time|
|——-|——–|——–|
|Typing|127K characters|10.6 hours|
|Mouseclicking|32K clicks|9.1 hours|</p>

<h3 id="savings">Savings</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Activity</th>
      <th>#</th>
      <th>Time</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Typing</td>
      <td>24K characters.</td>
      <td>2 hours</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mouseclicking</td>
      <td>5K clicks</td>
      <td>1.5 hours</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The time saved on clicking is probably much more given some macros save 30 seconds. For example, consider labs in order tracking. For planned care visits (checkups, diabetes, hypertension, etc), I have a macro that notes ‘Will discuss…’, signs it off, removes it from ordertracking. Every day I use it a couple times and it saves me about a minute of documentation. Improves my record-keeping, reduces my stress.</p>

<pre><code>; Planned Care Lab. Annotes a lab to Discuss, signs, removes from order tracking
^+p::
IfWinActive, Patient Chart
{
click, 915, 150
WinWaitActive, Memo
Sleep, 200
SendInput, Discuss at already scheduled 'planned-care' visit.
click, 435, 439
WinWaitActive, Patient Chart
{
sleep, 200

click, 51, 182
sleep 200
click, 70, 259
sleep, 200
Send !fx
}
}
return
</code></pre>

<p>So using my low level data as a family doctor, generally living in e-MDs all day long: I’ve got more than 1 hour straight clicking/typing per typical workday. And Macros/Abbreviations save me about 15% of the typing/clicking. That’s probably my limit because most months are about the same. It’s a local maximum for me. I can write more macros but I won’t get that much improvement</p>

<p><img src="/files/2011/03/local-maximum.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="http://52weeksofux.com/post/694598769/the-local-maximum">Local Maximum</a> is a key concept. You can only <em>optimize</em> so far. Sometimes you need to <em>redesign</em>. This applies macros, or to practice processes or graphic design.</p>

<p>So unless the situation changes (say, Meaningful Use changing workflows and adding clicking), I’m only going to get so far with macros and abbreviations. I’ll still use them a lot partly because they work well with my style. But if I really want to get done quicker, I either need to decrease quantity (type and click less), increase speed (probably not going to help much), or change method (Dragon Naturally Speaking, better templates, better delegation, hire a scribe, et cetera.)</p>

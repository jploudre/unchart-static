<p>I’ve been waiting for this!</p>

<p>Nuance has found a way to finally cut the cord on dictation. In the past, dictation could be done with audio files on a mobile recorder. It doesn’t really work as a workflow – you don’t see/correct errors until after the download. They offer dication over a remote connection if you are dictating into a microphone hooked up to the local computer. Although I’m sure someone can use that, it’s not really remote dication. </p>

<p>The iPhone has long been known to have some pretty sweet hardware including it’s microphone. Grumo Media (maker of awesome demo videos for startups) has an article about <a href="http://http://grumomedia.com/how-to-record-great-voiceover-audio-with-an-iphone/">how to use your iPhone to do great voiceovers</a>. It’s already in my pocket, couldn’t I just use this to dictate?</p>

<p>Dragon Remote Microphone does that. This requires 11.5 (for use with e-MDs that could be Professional which I use. Or Premium ought to work fine, too. <a href="/2011/using-dragon-with-e-mds/">No need to wait/spend for Medical. </a>)</p>

<p>So now my workflow is this: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Come out of a room.</li>
  <li>Whip out my phone, hit the Microphone button in the App. </li>
  <li>Dicate a few sentences. Slip phone in pocket. </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s fast enough to feel like I can do it for just a few sentences. Very little friction.</p>

<h3 id="it-gets-more-mobile">It get’s more mobile…</h3>

<p>Using it in the office is slick since it saves me from logging into my desktop to dictate. And saves me walking to the desktop, albeit only 20 feet away. In the middle of the morning when someone is waiting reducing the ~30 seconds means I’m more likely to finish off the note.</p>

<p>But it also means I can use my iPhone to dictate into my iPad in e-MDs. Or it means I can VPN my phone into my work network and then dictate from my home.</p>

<h3 id="how-well-does-it-work">How well does it work?</h3>

<p>Accuracy is difficult to benchmark. On my desktop, I use a relatively nice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-USB-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000AP1RE8">$80 Samson USB Microphone.</a>. Clearly the remote microphone doesn’t work as well. It seems a little slower than doing it locally. But it’s still more on the ‘magical’ than the ‘frustrating’ side. And for shorter dication (paragraph or two) the convenience and speed clearly outweigh the decrease in accuracy.</p>

<p>It incidentally fixes a longstanding bug for me. When you remote into a computer running Dragon, it would never work again. I used to restart Dragon to dictate again. Wait half a minute or more for it to restart. More Friction. Turns out, switching profiles works after RDP but I had never tried that since I only had one profile. Now I switch from Desktop to Remote profiles and it continues to work.</p>

<p>This really is changing my work and will help me get things done quicker with better narrative in my documentation.</p>

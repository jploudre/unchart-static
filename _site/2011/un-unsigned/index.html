  <p>Much e-MDs is focused on visits to the doctor. (Chart, Bill, Schedule). But it also  has panel-managment tools like Order Tracking, Refills, Unsigned Notes. These let you at a glance see how your practice is doing overall.</p>

<p><strong>Un-Unsigned</strong> is a panel management tool for making sure that you’re signing off the thousands of documents that come your way. It helps you mistake-proof against things being mishandled. It automates flipping through unsigned scans and labs.</p>

<p>In the standard e-MDs report, there are many documents that may never need to be signed off (administrative forms, etc.) And it’s a serious drain on your energy to open up each person’s  account so you can find the document to sign off. On my <strong>Un-Unsigned</strong>, there’s a custom crystal report (which may need to be customized for your practice). In our practice, the report eliminates many faxes and financial forms, for example.</p>

<h4 id="installing-un-unsigned">Installing Un-Unsigned</h4>

<p>There are multi-step instructions included in the zip. Directions assume familiarity with e-MDs and some of the technical bits. </p>

<h4 id="using-un-unsigned">Using Un-Unsigned</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Tip: Clear out taskman and order tracking first.</li>
  <li>Open the app</li>
  <li>Go into e-MDs</li>
  <li>Hit F5 to collect your unsigned documents (takes about a half minute)</li>
  <li>Hit F1 for the next document</li>
  <li>Learning/Using the keyboard shortcuts in the macro will make you quicker over time.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Known Issue 1</strong> In my clinic, computers have different installs (say, no Bill) so that causes problems for the macro. Wifi problems can also cause it to crash. I could make it more resilient by slowing it down but that degrades it for me personally since I like having it run quickly. I do have a few partners who use this regularly.</li>
  <li><strong>Known Issue 2</strong> This includes documents assigned to me. But sometimes the reason it is unsigned was that it wasn’t assigned to me. I plan to add a patient-centered report (my patients, documents that are unsigned whether they are mine to sign or not.)</li>
  <li><strong>Tested on:</strong> e-MDs 6.32</li>

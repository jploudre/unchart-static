  <p>This is a basic report for provider panel size. It’s based on patients that have visited the clinic (not just in the database). My clinic has been using e-MDs for 3 years  so looking at all visits has been an OK shortcut. Most experts recommend using a shorter interval for estimating panel size (12-18 months, typically.) That could be adjusted pretty easily in Crystal Reports, if it was important.</p>

<p>This report pays attention to exempted patients (Using ‘Exempt from Reports’ in Demographics) if you use that in your clinic process for transferred or discharged patients.</p>

<h3 id="adjusting-not-worth-it-for-me">Adjusting? Not worth it for me.</h3>

<p>Obviously providers have different recall style (doctors who encourage more frequent feedback need an effectively smaller panel) and different panel makeup (male versus female providers, for example.)</p>

<p>One time I used a set of conversion factors to adjust for the age/sex of patients. (<a href="http://primarycareforall.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Panels-in-Primary-Care.pdf">See Panel Equity Article</a>.) Interesting experiment – some female providers at my clinic have 85% female patients. Some docs do OB (and see lots of pediatric patient who have a lot of visits.) But rank order of panels was essentially unchanged. This simple panel measure is good enough for our clinic.</p>

<h3 id="panel-size-is-clinic-wide-too">Panel Size is clinic-wide, too.</h3>

<p>One of the things I learned by looking at panel size is that larger clinic dynamics matter. I could fix my availability and have a right-sized panel and still have problems. If a partner is overburdened, the patients will spill over. To really get success in managing panels, I think you have to consider  the whole clinic as much as individual providers. </p>

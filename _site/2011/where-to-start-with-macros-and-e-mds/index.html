  <p>Ah, too many clicks. Macros are one of my loves the last few years. Reduce a single thought into a single physical action. It’s not that I can’t click 5 times to do one thing. <em>Actually, I’m pretty good at clicking</em>. As I’ve mentioned in my <a href="/2011/deskilling/">article about becoming my patient’s data entry technician</a>, I’ve got limited attention bandwidth. Clicking requires too much focus. I practice EHR all the time; I should be able to play it like a piano. I need a single thought to be a single frictionless action.</p>

<h2 id="macros-lubricate-your-life-as-a-doctor">Macros lubricate your life as a doctor</h2>

<p>Wouldn’t it be great if it could just <strong>__</strong>___ with one click?</p>

<p>When I’ve talked to docs about this, they tend to <strong>aim way to high</strong>. They start thinking about clinical scenarios that are brain intensive. I think that’s the wrong place to start. Start with the mundane stuff.  Don’t start programming Autohotkey! I know I’ve mentioned it a bazillion times, but it’s not the place to start. Especially if you’re still learning your workflows. It’s a waste of time to automate workflows you are going to discard. Don’t automate a clinical task you do once a week. Get boring things like opening attachments (which I do dozens of times daily.)</p>

<p><strong>First:</strong> Download <a href="/2011/e-mds-macros/">my macros</a> first.</p>

<p>These turn common/boring actions in taskman, order tracking, etc into keystrokes you can do without looking at the screen. I think you’ll have ROI of 1-2 weeks for your time. Not to mention this fixes about 5000 typos you might make. <a href="/2011/e-mds-macros/">My e-MDs macros</a> definitely lubricate your life.</p>

<p><strong>Second:</strong> If you are going to learn autohothey, at the beginning learn just one thing: hotstrings.</p>

<p>For hotstrings, I’d initially focus on ‘doctor sentences’ that you say somewhat frequently but don’t fit into your templates. These are quick to set up and save real typing. So for example:</p>

<pre><code> ::dflonase::Discussed usage and demonstrated how to use nasal corticosteroids.
 ::epw::Explored patient's willingness.
 ::innl::Inform patient normal results.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Third:</strong> Later when you’ve got your feet under you, feel free to use the source code of my macros to see how exactly I programmed them. This shows you ways to automate e-MDs and when you see how I do things it’ll give you ideas about how to make macros that are less fragile as e-MDs updates their software.</p>

<p><strong>Last:</strong> If you make a macro that’s great for you, send it my way, I’d love to have ideas.</p>

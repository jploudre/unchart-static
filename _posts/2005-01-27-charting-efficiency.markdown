### Why is Charting Efficiency so Important?

If you've done this business for any amount of time, that seems like a silly question. There is so much work to be done that no doc has time to waste on charting. Everyone develops shortcuts and tricks to  try and save time. Examples:

* Voice Dictation
* Paper Templates
* Mental Templates (so you don't have to think so hard)
* Superbills
* Electronic phrases and shortcuts

Every physician does this to some extent. But there's a tradeoff. Quicker charting can lead to lesser quality. If you spent more time, you surely could write a more accurate note. Alternatively, automating the 'boilerplate' material frees you to spend more effort on the unique part of each encounter.

###Electronic Medical Chart Efficiency

Electronic Medical Charts can be much quicker looking up material. When you can resort labs to find a TSH from 2 years ago that can be quicker than flipping through all the old labs of a paper chart. On the other hand, electronic charts can take a lot more time on the front end. Typing a blood pressure into the blood pressure field takes longer than scrawling it onto a sticky note. What if you have to log in to record that blood pressure. There goes more time.

Let's run the numbers:

* Say changing something saves you 5 seconds per visit.
* A typical primary care doc might have 6,000 or more visits in a year
* Over the course of a 30 year career you are talking about saving > 50 days of work by saving 5 seconds.

Is that right? 50 workdays! It's easy to see why people love dictating. But it also emphasizes how ruthless we need to be about efficiency. Any tiny change can really payback over the course of a career. *How can I save 5 seconds today?*

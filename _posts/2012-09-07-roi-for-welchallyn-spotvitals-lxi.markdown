A few years ago, I put together this analysis. I don't know that it's still accurate. I believe the WelchAllyn SpotVitals is over-priced but it still has a reasonable ROI given that it really can speed up vitals. -- *Jonathan*

------------------
 

Spot Vitals LXi
---------------

* Connects directly into e-MDs
* Takes about 15 seconds to do BP/HR vitals
* Can connect to a electronic scale so weight gets imported, too.
* Costs $2000 - $3500 (quick googling, not comparison shopping.)

Direct ROI
----------

* In setting of  possible MA turnover, reduces BP variability
* Assume it saves 30 seconds (fast BP, less manual transcription), that translates to more than 2 full days of staff work. About 2000 vitals per side of the clinic monthly.

(**ROI 1.5 years**. More or less depending on how much time it actually saves. I think 30 seconds is low)


Indirect ROI
------------

* More efficient MAs would mean nurses would not have to room as many patients. 
* Reduce Doctor waiting on rooming patients
* Improve pt satisfaction (quicker rooming)
* Improve eye contact/friendliness of rooming (MAs wouldn't have to look at computer nearly as much.
* Thigh cuffs would reduce temptation for MAs to get inaccurate BPs in order to save time of walking to central pod.
* Eliminate transcription errors
* Improve MA/Nurse Morale with less 'scut work'.

(**ROI 3-6 months** given all the ripple benefits.)

We add a special pop up alert to patients who have a name that is the same or similar to existing patients.  For example, I worry about a medical assistant calling someone with lab results and not noticing that they have the wrong "Bob Smith."  A pop-up doesn't solve the problem, but at least the pop up will make our better staff double-check DOB.  This is also good for catching patients who have two charts (you'll notice same/similar name and same DOB).

(**This is a tremendous report!** Reduce Name errors. This is a patient safety issue. -- *JP*)

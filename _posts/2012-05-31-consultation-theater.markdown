A while back a college friend turned me on to [Strengthsfinder](http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx). My strengths are Strategic, Ideation, Input, Learner and Self-Assurance. I can identify with other strengths but these fit, too. Ideation is Strengthsfinder terminology for a person who loves coming up with and thinking about ideas.

That's definitely me. 

Our group is starting to think about re-investing Meaningful Use money. We're trying a simplified process of deciding (it's time-consuming to get a large consensus). My thought was to make it "innovative but not foolish." Now, when I start talking about innovation, people think I'm talking about tech. I do love tech but I like how Bell Labs President Mervin Kelly described innovation: [Cheaper, or Better or Both](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-22/book-review-the-idea-factory-by-jon-gertner).

So I'm looking for things that make our care cheaper or better (or both) and are not foolish. 

**First Plan:** [WelchAllyn Spot Vitals LXi](http://unchart.com/2012/welchallyn-spotvitals-lxi/) helps making rooming faster (that's cheaper via less time) and has the potential to reduce variability of readings (that's better) and our clinic has about 4000 visits a month (so it'll be really used. Practical!) There have been some questions about reliability of readings at Mid-State Health but I've got to try one.

**Second Plan:** Bigger Monitors for our Receptionists ([23 inch Dell Monitors for $180](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l;=en&s;=bsd&cs;=04&sku;=320-2943&~ck=baynoteSearch&baynote;_bnrank=3&baynote;_irrank=0)). By seeing more allows receptionists to work slightly faster. (Cheaper Checkins). Screens are more energy
efficience (cheaper). Larger screen will allow showing multiple schedules. More monitor space will be nice for morale, too. Not Foolish: These will be used continuously.

But my third idea is my doozy. Since i spend most of my time with my laptop near my nurse (intentional plan to allow better interuption and informal conversation), I'm not sure I really need my offices. So I've decided I should make a consultation theater.

### The Consultation Theater

There are several parts to this idea. Back in the day, doctors used to use their offices to have conversations and consultations. After a lengthy consultation, you might go the the exam room to continue the visit and back to the office for the final plan. Not super 'lean' but it allows a more comfortable discussion. HIPAA has long killed the old version -- at least for me. I could never keep a completely privacy-aware desk space. I've been interested in doing a better job with patient education via videos. But not everyone has youtube or internet. Thus the consultation theater is born.

I'm imagining my desk in a corner (I have a Dragon Dictation Setup with my desktop PC). The main space will have a kitchen table with 4 chairs -- enough for the vast majority of discussions I do. I'm hoping the make the feel 'homey' where we can sit around a table and discuss what to do. Maybe I'll have a way to brew Tea or Coffee. Or possibly pop popcorn.  I'll use this room for certain types of visits (Follow up from an MRI Scan, Follow up starting an antidepressnant, etc). 

Theater-wise, I plan a large TV mounted on the wall for video or to show Digital XR. I'll get an iPad and an AppleTV to wirelesly show info on the TV. On the iPad I'll sometimes mirror over e-MDs from my desktop, when it's needed. The iPad will be loaded with videos that I commonly recommend. Sometimes I'll use the theater for some simple brief education (Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor, Info about starting certain types of medications.) In some visits I'll try to start the education part earlier and go work on great patient instructions in my Visit Summary.

So, Consultation-Theaters aren't as well known as clock-radios or  camera-phones or chocalate-peanut butter. But I think this combo has some real potential.

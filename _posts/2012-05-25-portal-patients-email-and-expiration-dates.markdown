Hereâ€™s another report by Bill Sweeney from Mid-State Health.

Bill creates awesome flat file reports. This is just begging for some simple list work in  Excel (See my [Data-Driven Practice](http://unchart.com/2011/data-driven-practice/) page). 

In my practice we didn't fully realize how expiration dates worked. We used 1 year later -- now patients portal is expiring. We need to change the date to a later one. I think we're going to use a macro to loop through and update expiration dates. It'll be the [same technique I used to add preventive flowsheet](http://unchart.com/2011/macro-to-add-flowsheets-in-e-mds/) by looping through a list of accounts.

"The future is already here -- it's just not very evenly distributed."  
 ---William Gibson

## The Basics 

**What:** Practice Improvement Webinar hosted by UnChart for e-MDs users.  
**How:** Roundtable discussion of participants about attempts at practice improvement.  
**When:** Friday, March 23, 2012.  
**When:** 10am -12pm  Pacific; 11am - 1pm Mountain; 12pm - 2pm Central; 1pm - 3pm Eastern.  
**Where:** A quiet place for you to Webex (via Computer, iPad, iPhone, Android.)  
**Commitments:** 1) A $20 Coordination Fee per location. Feel free to bring partners to your webex. 2) A story of change -- an improvement or a failed change. And what you learned.  
**Limits:** This is a smallish roundtable. ~ 20 participants.   

I'm interested in connecting with other innovative docs. I want to hear stories of improvements that worked. I want to hear stories about changes that flopped. I want to distill the expertise of other docs that are working on the same problems I am.

As of 4 years ago, [Only 4% of ambulatory practices had a complete EHR](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa0802005#t=article) like e-MDs. Generally, docs using e-MDs are way ahead of the curve. It's time we collaborate more with our colleagues. Let's learn from docs that are working on their second year of Meaningful Use. 

e-MDs hosts a 'User Conference'. It's aimed at basic and intermediate users. At UnChart, I'm thinking I'd like to go to a *Clinical Innovation Summit*. Since I couldn't find the conference I wanted to attend, **I've decided to host it myself**. But 'innovation' has baggage because people wrongly think I mean tech or macros or crystal reports.  So I want to focus on Practice Improvement as part of innovation. 

## Discussion, not lecture

Seriously: **Do Not Sign Up** if you're not willing to share. I'm hoping to create a lively discussion. No freeloaders. Don't expect that we'll run out of time before your turn....

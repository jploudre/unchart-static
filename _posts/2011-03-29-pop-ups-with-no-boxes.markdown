Our staff chronically write pop up alerts and forget to check any of the boxes.  This looks for those instances so we can manually correct.  It's a quick fix, so I run it about one a week.

(My [macro for looping through charts](/2011/macro-to-add-flowsheets-in-e-mds/) could be useful with this. Add the account number and then loop through the alerts. -- *JP*)

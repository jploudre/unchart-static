So the theme I pull out of this: Patients have a stronger preference for access than doctors have. We're all used to creating walls to protect us from too much access. To me, that might be  a symptom of not being careful about managing your panel size. (See my recent [Provider Panel Report](http://unchart.com/2011/provider-panel-report/) as a starting spot.)

Thanks to Andy Helm and Georgia HITREC for security-related info for Meaningful Use. (And Thanks to Samuel Church, MD/MPH, for hooking this up for sharing.)

This includes two major tools: a spreadsheet tool for conducting a security audit and a document with principles of security and checklists for applying them in a small practice. Good stuff.

To get the spreadsheet, you need to contact Andy Helm via e-mail or phone.

If you're looking for a beautiful overview of security, Kyle Homstead's presentation from the e-MDs User Conference in 2010 is excellent. It has been available on supportcenter in the past. Doesn't seem to be on his blog at Healthlens.org anymore.

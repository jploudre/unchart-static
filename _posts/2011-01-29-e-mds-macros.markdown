Here's my package of e-MDs macros. You can see the source and compile it with Autohotkey. 

*Your "I'm done" makes me one fast dude, and I've used it for most of a year. --**Keith Toms, MD. Hopkinsville, KY***

#### Why Download and install it on every computer in your company?

**Automatic typo correction** for the ~5K of the most common typos. TaDa! Now everyone's a better typer.  
The **'I'm Done' button** (Win-Spacebar) quickly get's you out of common places like the Patient Alert.  
**Taskman Macros**, especially the 'Open Attachment', speed up getting work done.  
**It's free.**

Or  if you want to do it from scratch for security reasons:

1. Download [Autohotkey](http://autohotkey.com)
2. Change the extension to .ahk (look inside, if you're interested)
3. Use the compiler from autohokey.

Here's my info handout for patients getting Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring. It's got some nice specifics: About 90 seconds to read, 8th Grade reading level. But it covers the key points I've learned with my first ~15 patients who've done ABPM.

---------

Your doctor has recommended you get "Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring". This is a portable cuff that will take about 100 readings over the course of 24 hours. By looking at averages and variability (both day and night) it helps us do a better job of diagnosing and treating high blood pressure. In some cases it can be used to decrease medicines or eliminate them. In others, it can make sure medicines are working like they are supposed to work.

## What happens

* We hook you up to the cuff. And turn on the machine.
* If you switch clothes, try to change between checks. But the monitor on bare skin underneath your sleeve.
* When it starts to go off, let your arm relax down by your side.
* Sometimes the pump will go off twice and pump extra tight -- this is normal and is because of a high reading or a difficult reading for it to hear.
* After  24 hours, return the monitor.
* We'll download the monitor and give the results to your doctor.
* After your doctor has had a chance to review the results the doctor/nurse will contact you with the results and plan. Sometimes this might be handled best in person and we'll ask you to make an appointment.

## Possible Hassles

* Some people find the cuff unbearable/too tight.
* It can disrupt your sleep when it goes off at night. (But nighttime blood pressure is important medically so we'd really like to know what's happening then.)
* It could bruise your arm or make your bicep sore.

If you have a problem with the monitor or can't tolerate it, just take it off and return it to the clinic. We'd appreciate if you gave us a quick note of what happened.

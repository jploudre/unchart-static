This report is a doozy. It solves a quality issue: keeping the PCP in the loop. As a family doctor, I can tell you which practices have a foolproof system for sending me letters and which ones I have to nag and waste time repeatedly requesting records when I referred them. 

If you're a consultant and don't have a system for insuring that records are repeatedly sent, **get started**. 

If you do have a process: Could this automate it for you. I consider a fab report to be one that solves a real problem and gets run and used regularly. For consultants, this is fab. 

This creates a coversheet and then the notes (only those marked as NEWP or CONS). Obviously this needs to be modified per clinic but it's a template.

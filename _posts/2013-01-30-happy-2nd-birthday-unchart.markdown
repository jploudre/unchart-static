- About Unchart
---

It's been about 2 years since I started UnChart. I thought I'd do a run through of the numbers. I love analytics. There's been about 9500 visits, averaging just under 4 minutes on the site. About 5000 unique visitors. Here's my traffic over the 2 years. That spike in the middle was the Meaningful Use Stage 2 Summary for Providers that John Crankshaw and I did.

The top 4 browsers were IE, Chrome, Firefox and Safari. In that order. I find that interesting because for several years I have complained to e-MDs that Portal doesn't layout appropriately in Modern Browsers. Less than half of my visitors use Internet Explorer. [That campaign to convince e-MDs to fix portal usability](http://unchart.com/2012/encourage-e-mds-to-fix-portal-usability/) was probably the first time SupportCenter had been used systematically to raise awareness with e-MDs. Interesting coincidence, a couple weeks later, the exact fix that I had recommended went out to Portal.

Google is now a significant source of traffic -- I've had about a couple thousand visitors from Google links. (Comparatively: for me, Bing is 20x smaller. No other search engine shows up.) There are no advertisements (other than, I guess, stuff I advertise for myself.) 

### The Content..... 

I wrote most of the posts here. I've definitely had help from a number of other people who've shared their work. Thanks Chris, Bill, Sara, John, Chat, Keith, and a few others. THere have been 120 posts. Some are articles, others are just placeholders for crystal reports or other downloads. Since I've started teaching on my 'day off' last July, the site has been less active. 

My top posts: 

* [Unchart Visit Summary](http://unchart.com/unchart-visit-summary/). (Which now has about 3500 uses/week!) 
* [Stage 2 Proposed Guidelines](http://unchart.com/2012/stage-2-proposed-guidelines/) (the spike of traffic, handout was downloaded ~800 times) 
* [e-MDs Macros](http://unchart.com/2011/e-mds-macros/) (My tool for making daily work faster) 
* [Where to Start with macros and e-MDs](http://unchart.com/2011/where-to-start-with-macros-and-e-mds/). 

I spent some time optimizing the site. I like speed. A typical page loads in 2.5 seconds. Hopefully that makes browsing more enjoyable for people. 95% of visit are straight browsing (not using search.)

### Year 3

The biggest news for the next year on the site is that John Crankshaw is joining me on this. He's already on the sidebar! I've got some other project that I'm working on -- in particular an app that helps new MAs do refills via protocol. More about that soon.....

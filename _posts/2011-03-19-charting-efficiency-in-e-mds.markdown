In my post about [snappy charting](http://unchart.com/2011/snappy-charting/) I talked about some of the theories about making charting fast.
Ranging from big to small, here's the toolset e-MDs provides for efficient charting.

|This:|Does This:|
|-----|--------|
|Shortcut |Whole template note entered at once including all the hx, exam, orders, billing |
|Past Visit |Copies a whole note from this particular patient|
|Pre-Click |A template of a note section |
|Past Click (Clock)|A previous note section from a note on this particular patient|
|QuickPick Prescription |Complete Prescription with all detail |

As you look here, there's a theme of abbreviation. Combine some chunk of clicks/text in a template or note and make it doable in a few clicks. Definitely saves time over doing a whole note from scratch.

These should definitely be considered targets for [Practice-based Evidence](http://unchart.com/2011/practice-based-evidence/) -- use the data from your own practice to optimize your practice.

* **Shortcut:** Report out ICDs by frequency to make sure you have appropriate common shortcuts.
* **Preclicks:** [I have a crystal report of preclicks by user and template](preclicks-by-template-or-by-provider). Allows you to see popular templates for preclick to make sure you're taking advantage of options that your partners are using
* **Quickpick:** Report of Prescriptions by Provider sorted by frequency. Use your top 50 to work through your favorite prescriptions.

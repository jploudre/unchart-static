I'm going to be doing a diabetic group visit -- a dinner club.  

Why would I offer to give free food as part of a doctor visit?

* By going over dinnertime, I can make it easier for diabetics with a job to stay on top of diabetes.
* Exemplify some healthy meals
* Time savings of group visits over individual visits give me more practice flexibility (open up appointment slots)
* Longer-time of group visit allows much more learning than routine visits.

I have about 80 diabetics in my practice. I'm hoping to get about half to join a dinner club for a year. Good food, good conversation and good diabetic care.

## My invitation (text)

I’m starting a **diabetes ‘dinner club’** that will meet every 3 months for a year.  This will be a group visit where you’ll get your labs done, related refills and a chance for one-on-one time with me. Like other doctor visits, if you have a co-pay, you’ll still have to do that. (Sorry, I don’t control the healthcare system!)

But, unlike a regular doctor visit, **I’ll be providing dinner** and we’ll have time as a group to eat  and discuss diabetes & how to care for it. We’ll make something tasty (and appropriate for diabetes!) to eat. I’m doing this at dinnertime so that if you have a job you don’t have to take much/any time off to come to this longer visit.
I did group visits a few years ago and people really seemed to enjoy them. Sometimes it’s easier to learn from someone else’s questions.

**Time:** 5:00 - 7:00 pm 
**Date:** Tuesday, 4/3/2012
**Where:** At the Office
**RSVP:** Call and leave a message with my nurse Heather. 428-1700
I’m going to limit this to 8 people so call now to reserve a spot. 

Hope you can come!
Dr. Jonathan Ploudre

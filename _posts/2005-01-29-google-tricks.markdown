Google is definitely one of my core tools as a geek. I am often in a conversation and I think of how I could choose 3 words that would  have google get me the answer to a question. Anyhow: I'm reading *Google Hacks* by O'reilly and thoght I should record my favorites for future use. These 'keywords' allow you to limit searches to useful subsets.

* link: Pages that link to a particular page
* filetype: Documents like PDF files, or PPT files
* intitle: Pages whose title contain a particular word
* inurl: Pages like above but in the URL

So, for example, say you are doing a presentation on hypertension. You could do this search in google to see what powerpoints are on the internet for ideas:

     hypertension filetype:ppt

*2011 Update* This trick is still useful and very few people are aware of it. Google-fu is still a skill that is unevenly distributed in the population. Spending some time with the most recent version of 'Google Hacks' is still a useful idea.

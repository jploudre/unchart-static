### What if you're starting out?

Here's my philosophical overview of how to achieve meaningful use for WIREC's Meaningful Use Best Practices Forum.

Here are the thoughts that go with the slides:

* In 2008 only 1/5 ambulatory practices have an EMR and 1/25 have a 'full' EMR.
* With Meaningful Use, there's an set of actions that show you're using a full EMR to an extent.
* This can be seen as an opportunity for innovation (my take) but it's also a set of restrictions. It could worsen care, too. (Consider: [Deskilling](/2011/deskilling/))
* Having shared benchmarks makes it much easier for clinics to innovate. Once you know how you will be measured, it's simpler to figure out what changes you might want to do.
* Pitfall: This isn't at all about tech. It's not about the Gigahertz or Hardware. It's about how **people do clicking**. It's sociopolitical and process even though all the attention is focused on Health IT.
* Pitfall: Even the most independent/caring/intelligent/hardworking doctor can be inefficient. To efficiently achieve meaningful use you need a team. Reception, Nursing, Physicians, Admin all play a role. Don't be a lone cowboy.
* Pitfall: If you don't carve out some breathing room away from the demands of business and patient care, you'll struggle with doing this well.
* Tool: Boyd's Law. Speed of iteration beats quality of iteration. So instead of making some big/great/complicated change once a month, make 4 smaller/simpler changes. Focus on how quickly you can try things, get feedback, fix what doesn't work.
* Tool: [Plan-Do-Study-Act Process](/2011/pdsa-and-meaningful-use/) 

So in a tweet, I'd say: 
 
**Make space to think as a team, make mistakes and learn from them, Repeat quickly.**

**Update**: New version 6/17/2011 by Chris. She says:

     I took off the word Medicare in the percentage 
     description for Core Criteria #13. Instead of reading 
     "50% of Medicare patients", it now reads "50% 
     of patients".  I also added to Menu Set #2 Lab Results
     in EHR as Structured Data that the lab results must 
     be signed off to be counted in the denominator. 

In a similar spirit to [my Meaningful Use Kickoff Presentation](http://unchart.com/2011/meaningful-use-map-and-kickoff/), Christine Hunter, PA, put together 2 summaries of the MU benchmarks.

These two word documents have screenshots (warning: big files!) and explain benchmarks with a practical summary of what it means for a practice. I can imagine printing these out and sitting around with partners to make sure they are clear. Consider it a 'cliff notes' to the videos on Supportcenter.

Hey everyone!

I'm a third year medical student at [Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences](http://pnwu.edu), home of the [Mighty Mustangs](http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000BQUKFpgQ1Tk/s/870/wild-horse-mustang-Mwhrs0966.jpg)! I currently live in Mount Vernon, WA and am stumbling along as a [Junior Doctor](http://theandrewmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Doogie-Friends-doogie-howser-md-2676324-370-278.jpg)...my wife's most endearing pet name...at [Skagit Valley Hospital](http://www.skagitvalleyhospital.org/).

I am very happily married to my beautiful and creative wife, [Laura](http://j29eleven.blogspot.com/), who gave me the world's cutest and strongest-willed kid, Parker J. Life as a daddy, husband, medical student, friend, son, [sibling](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1126273-18-year-old-katie-collier-overcomes-cancer-on-her-way-to-mcdonalds-all-american) and more...can be a bit [hectic](http://www.staceyreid.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Juggler.png), but I love my life and am so blessed. 

The great state of Washington has always been my home, living in Kent, Seattle, Yakima, and now in Mount Vernon. I did have a quick stint in [Granada, Spain](http://hotelanacapri.com/upload/image/alhambra-5.jpg) while a junior at the University of Washington...[Go Dawgs!!](http://pics4.city-data.com/cpicc/cfiles199.jpg)...and subsequently got bit by the travel bug, which unfortunately isn't too conducive with the med student lifestyle and non-existent salary. 

I can't claim the prestigeous title of Geek, like my Unchart.com superiors, but hopefully they can help me change that. I did grow up in the world of dial-up AOL, giving me madd middle-school [AIM flirting skillz](http://pennalumniblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/aim-chat.gif), and I was in undergrad when [TheFacebook](http://www.inc.com/uploaded_files/image/facebook-2004_11934.jpg) made its debut. I like computers and I kind of know how to use them. Let's do this!

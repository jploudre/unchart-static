Evidence-based medicine (EBM) has been a fad in medical training and practice over the last decade. The premise is straightforward: use the best available evidence when making clinical decisions. The gold standard is the randomized double-blind large scale clinical trial. Generally we think of this as the most reliable form of evidence. It's not perfect ([publishing bias](http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/287/21/2847.full) can even effect the [most popular studies](http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/294/2/218.abstract).)

In training, this seemed pretty simple. I just needed to learn the results of the key clinical trials and then I'd know what to do when I was taking care of patients. Any practicing doc know how naive this is. Though patients are rightly wowed by the night health segment on the news, the reality is that most of what we do is not resultant from gold-standard evidence. Anecdotes and personal experience and expert opinion are more common than we wish they were. 

One additional problem (maybe this s sematics) with EBM is the focus on quantitative issues. There's a bias towards measuring things that are easily measurable or countable. So, LDL get's measured because it can be. Sometimes studies have patient-oriented evidence (say, heart attack survival) but often there are surrogate markers like the LDL. But how much weight do the studies put on having to take a medicine daily for decades to possibly prevent something? That 'cost' to a patient isn't at all easy to measure. Yet it's a common and significant barrier to care. 

Still, quibbles aside, here's my addition. Practice-based evidence. With EHRs, we are all generating tons of structured data that we could use to improve care. The goal is to have pervasive reporting to measure what's actually happening in a practice. 

Some examples:

* I want to take advantage of the quick prescription feature of my EHR. First run a report of you most frequently prescribed medications. That's Practice-based evidence of where to start. 
* We have some almost expired Humulin insulin. (This happened a couple weeks ago.) Report out people we could give it to. 
* Do we have to all be here the day after Christmas?  Report out your previous Boxing Day schedules, see how many were acute visits, etc. Use the schedule to estimate this year's demand. 

Obviously, reporting needs to be much simpler if we're all going to take advantage of it. Still, how many of us really exploit the built-in reports? Even if the evidence is easy to find, do we use this best available evidence?

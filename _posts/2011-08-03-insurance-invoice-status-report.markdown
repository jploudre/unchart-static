Chat Kidkul made this report

Chat says:

     This being used by billing to track down 
     invoices still sitting out there waiting for action.  
     It will pull invoice with a balance and can be 
     broken down by financial group and payor.  
     This was created for use until e-MDS fixes 
     the insurance AR report.  There are still some 
     quirks to work out with this report but it may 
     be useful to get a snapshot of what invoice 
     is still out there.
     
I love reports that are 'implemented'. Download if you might actually have your billing use it.

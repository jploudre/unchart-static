Thanks to Angela Bashaw for sharing her orthopedic clinic's plan template.

Paraphrasing her (on [SupportCenter](https://supportcenter.e-mds.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=3222&forumContentID;=108107)):

    It includes 'closed treatment' codes which are your 
    'fracture care' codes ... options for casting and bracing 
    without a closed treatment that would charge an 
    application fee (ex. 29075 is application of a short arm cast). 
    Also an option for when a patient destroys the cast 
    and we need to replace it (we charge for that).

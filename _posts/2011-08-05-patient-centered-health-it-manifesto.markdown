If we are going to really get Health IT, we need to be patient-centered. It's generally being ignored now.

Modern health is phenomenal: Public Health/Sanitation/Antibiotics. Now 7% of Wealthy vs 36% of Poor die of infection in 2011.-- [National Geographic](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/03/age-of-man/map-interactive)

With modern medicine, much of main causes of death can be modified/prevented/managed by medications. Heart Disease, Stroke, Diabetes. --[CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm)

Effective medications (Great Evidence in Research), say for high blood pressure, don't work if people don't take them regularly. Half of patients self-discontinue. (Same/Worse for Statins.) -- [Circulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19805653?dopt=Abstract)

The underlying causes of death are behavioral (Tobacco Use, Poor Diet, Inactivity.) -- [JAMA](http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/291/10/1238.abstract)

Simple SMS message can double efficacy in behavior change (Tobacco Cessation) -- [The Lancet](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60701-0/fulltext).

Health Care and HIT organized like main frames. Centralized. Hospitals. Central Databases like in e-MDs. -- [Ted.com](http://www.ted.com/talks/eric_dishman_take_health_care_off_the_mainframe.html)

In a year, more than half of patients in the US will have smartphones. -- [Asymco.com](http://www.asymco.com/2011/07/09/switching-rates-for-us-smartphone-users-suggest-50-penetration-by-august-2012/) 

Focusing on actionable data, we can make medical data useful for patients making behavioral change. -- [Wired Magazine](http://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_goetz_it_s_time_to_redesign_medical_data.html)

Software mechanics can enable behavioral change. -- [Seth Priebatsch](http://www.ted.com/talks/seth_priebatsch_the_game_layer_on_top_of_the_world.html)

Now is the time to innovate on **patient-centered** health IT.  
Adherence and Behavior Change could be improved with phones our patients already have in their pocket.   
We need to enable patients as  partners in their care.

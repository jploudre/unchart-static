Mercy Moore has made a Word Form to create a 2 column visit note for printing for PCPs (to make it look shorter/more manageable.) [Discussion on SupportCenter][https://supportcenter.e-mds.com/ics/forum/Client/Common/ContentView.aspx?contentID=110220].

Mercy says:

     I had to put my name on top as we are only a one provider
     officeand  it would have added more clicks/steps to 
     note creation. For other offices, they can put the 
     referring MD name instead if they are a multiple 
     provider clinic.
     
     Please note: CONSULTANT  is the REFERRING 
     MD name the PCP is the REFERRED  MD name
     ( it's opposite as the sending doctor is the 
     referring doctor in e-MDs )

I'm planning on automating this with Autohotkey (as an experiement) to see if this process could work for her/others.

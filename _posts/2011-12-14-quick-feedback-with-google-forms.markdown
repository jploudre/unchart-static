Fred Wilson, a Venture Capitalist, has a [great blog post about continuous feedback](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/11/continuous-feedback.html). At a small startup they ask: What's three things we're doing well at? What's three things we need to do better?

Getting that type of feedback on a regular basis allows you to spot issues quickly. Or exploit strengths to do really brilliant work.

But most of us don't have a good way to do this quickly. Enter Google Forms.

### Google Forms: Your Feedback Collecting Robot

You create a simple form that you can then e-mail. The results get auto-entered into a spreadsheet so you can analyze without spending any grunt-work time. By lowering the friction of feedback, Google Forms can really rock work processes. Have all the nurses heard about the new policy? Does anyone have any issues with it? Couple minutes in Google Forms and you'll collect *anonymous* results. This works fine for subjective data (don't have 30 results in your inbox for you process manually!)

I wanted to know if my recent lecture to MS3s was on target so I did a 2 question form.

And now I know.

I'm hoping to use this pervasively to confirm that changes in our clinic have really gone through and that we know what the issues are.

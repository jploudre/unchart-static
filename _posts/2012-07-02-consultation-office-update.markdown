I am still in the process of turning my office into another exam room. Now that I use an electronic health record, I don't really actually need a physical office during most of the day. I don't tend to dictate during the middle of the day so giving up my office is not a big hassle.

The biggest problem with side projects like this, is finding time to do them. Yesterday afternoon I had a few hours while I was on call and so I got a table and have put it together.

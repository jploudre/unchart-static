I don't always log out and shutdown my computer every day. Partly because things change and sometimes I'm gone. I don't shutdown because I often log onto my machine from home (so it needs to be powered on). I don't plan learning to logout. It's nice to come back to the machine (via RDP) with everything open, right where I left it.

Having an open e-MDs client during backup, though, is a 'bad idea'. As in [Bad Idea Jeans](http://www.hulu.com/watch/10310/saturday-night-live-bad-idea-jeans).

I use a small freeware program to fix this:

I have mine set up like this (click on the screenshot to see it full size):

Down in the bottom left, I set up the timer like this. So everyday at 11pm it force logs out of my machine. When this app is on, you can see it's icon down in the system tray.

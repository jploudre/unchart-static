One of the setup tasks for portal is to create some standard messages -- disclaimers, warnings, and the like.  I had forgotten that it  was one of the things I 'ran through my readability program' I've been re-writing clinic paperwork for a while. My all time fav: [the HIPAA form](/2011/hipaa-form/) -- unrecognizable compared to the previous version. I also have a [Patient Portal Signup Form](/2011/patient-portal-form/). Until a couple months ago my office manager thought that I had an app that did simplification. Nope, I just edit/re-edit/reword until it's shorter, simpler and clearer.

Here's what we came up for portal auto-messages:

### Appointment Acknowledgement Message

Thanks for scheduling an appointment. We’ve got it and look forward to seeing you.  If you have any refill or referral requests, you might want to discuss that at your visit (rather than use the portal before the visit..) It’s a good idea review your medical history before you come in – you might be able to spot something to discuss or correct before we see you

### Appointment Disclaimer Message

We’re trying to make scheduling convenient for you! If you’re not sure about whether you’ve scheduled things right, you might want to call a receptionist during business hours.

### Email Notification Subject

We’ve sent you a message. Please check your patient portal account.

### Email Notification Message

You’ve got a new message in your secure mail box on our portal.

You can log on to the portal from our website:

http://ncfp.net

And click on the login button. 

Thanks, and we’ll be in touch,

North Cascade Family Physicians
360-428-1700

### Disclaimer Message

You can access the portal day or night, but we don't have a 24 hour presence on our end. If there's an emergency, you should go to Urgent Care, the Emergency Room or call 911. 

### Warning Message

Bedside manner is complicated via email. It’s easy to misread information or emotion. We'll try to keep things brief and clear on the Portal. We really appreciate your help on that, too. If a message takes a long time to write, it's probably better done in person.

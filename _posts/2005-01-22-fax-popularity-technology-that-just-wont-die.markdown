Fax Machine are 'old-school'. It made sense back when all the documents were paper (read: analog documents.) Nowadays people are taking their digital documents and faxing them through their modems. Seems like a bad idea on the surface -- you lose all the benefits of a digtality. Digtal documents don't take up space and can be easily filed or searched.

An article on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/articles/03/12/28/2055229.shtml?tid=126) explores why fax technology has not yet died. In particular, the [BBC Magazine Article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3320515.stm) explains some of the reasons why faxing seems to be gaining popularity. There has been a growth of fax-email gateways. That lets people fax straight to e-mail or e-mail straight to fax.

One of the big benefits of faxing is its reliability. Sure, fax machines can and do break. But it seems like *people* are more reliable using a fax machine. It's still too easy for people to accidentally delete e-mail or for someone to 'lose a file'.

Switching to an all digital approach could be great -- documents keep their color and legibility. But there are some analog benefits to fax -- it's so easy sign a fax and fax it back. And that is legally admissable. Getting rid of the fax machine is an eventual goal but currently we are not there yet. People think that technology can replace -- that computer faxing replaces fax machine faxing. But really things splinter -- faxing just shows up more and more ways.

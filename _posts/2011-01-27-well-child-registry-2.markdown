This report searches visits in the past three years for well child visits. It lists them by patient with the patient's current age (in months), and their age at each visit (in months again). It makes it quick to see which patients are overdue.

"I used your well child recall report 2 weeks ago and got some kids back in with it. -- Keith Toms, MD"

In my clinic of about a dozen providers, this runs about 65 pages long. But it only takes a few minutes to highlight all the patients who need appointments.

Bill Sweeney of Mid State Health re-worked the report to go up to age 17 and to include the ability to export to automated reminder calls. He says: 

     Anyone is interested I kinda supersized this report
     
     Added Last CPE Date, days since last CPE, expanded
     age range to 0 - 17, 
     
     created an appointment reminders group with first, last, 
     address, city , state, zip, phone, with PCP name this 
     can be exported and uploaded to autodialer,created a 
     mail merge group with first, last, address, city, state, 
     zip this can be used to send reminder letters or postcards,

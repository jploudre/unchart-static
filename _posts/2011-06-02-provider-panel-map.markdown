The general math behind defining a provider panel isn't complicated. But if you're trying to have useful discussions about panel management (hard!) a shared vocabulary can really help. [Mark Murray in Family Practice Mangement](http://www.aafp.org/fpm/2007/0400/p44.html) has a decent starting point. The Map is a way of tracking the issues -- should make sense after you've read the article. Although it's more sophistication than I've ever seen actually used/managed, it can help in separating overlapping issues.

Where to start.....

Thanks to Chris O'Grady for pointing this out to me.

Over the years I've struggled with Dragon. I think I've failed half a dozen times. With honest attempts -- where I tried something different to make it work. A newer version. A better microphone. More training. More customized vocabulary. A newer version. A better microphone. etc.

**Enunciation still is the key.** 

Dictation will never be complete magic for me because I misspeak and slur. But a few years of typing has helped me dicate better -- I'm more telegraphic and less rambly.   Within the limits of my enunciation, I thought my setup was working pretty darn well:

* Dragon 11.5 (Not Medical)
* [Samson C01U](http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/c01u/) microphone on a stand. (Respected for Podcasting. Great bang for buck)
* Custom Vocabulary made from my old dictations.

Chris takes a different approach: He uses Dragon Medical Version (which costs > $1000) and has a SpeechWare 3-in-1 Microphone (the highest rated table mike.) I prefer a table microphone, like Chris, because I hate taking the headset on and off.

So I decided to buy a [$279 Speechware Mic from Knowbrainer](http://www.knowbrainer.com/NewStore/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=402&idcategory;=58).

I have to say, I was surprised. I recreated a profile (pro tip: Any time you change Dragon Versions, your computer or your microphone, start a new profile. It's work but it makes sure that each part is being maximized.) And the performance is much better. I still slur certain words but it felt that nearly all of my errors are either slurring or words that aren't in my custom dictionary.

Now Dragon 12  is out with better accuracy. I'm using some of my Meaningful Use money to optimize my Dragon setup. A newer computer (mine's pushing 5 years old) and newer Dragon, I'm hoping this will really rock....

I'd recommend the Speechware TableMike for Docs using Dragon daily.

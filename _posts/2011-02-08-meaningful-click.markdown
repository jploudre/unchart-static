With Meaningful Use there will be a lot more clicking in life. Making sure that a patient's chart is up to date (Problems, Allergies, Medications, etc) is more important than ever. Especially now that patients will be getting copies of their clinical summaries with many visits.

Meaningful Click is an app for Docs using e-MDs that accelerates patient chart review. It allows you to tab through a review and updated things quickly with macro goodness. Using the macro makes it less error prone and faster.

### What it will do

* After starting the macro it will open each section for review with the 'tab' key.
* Processing through will automatically hit the 'review' buttons for each section.
* There will probably be some other specific macros like 'tobacco button'

#### Tabbing through the Health Summary

### Wanna Try It?

You can download it to use if you'd  like.

[![](/files/2011/01/57-download.png) Meaningful Click (March 7, 2011)](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/607655/meaningfulclick%2003072011.zip)

I use 'Windows Classic Theme' in XP. I can fix that but it's pretty low priority to me -- I want other features working for me, first. To change your theme:

* Right click on desktop
* In themes tab, choose Windows Classic

After you download the  .zip above, you'll find the 3 files, open meaningful click and you'll see a little green "H" added to the tray in the bottom right of your screen. You don't have to use the sounds but they really help me focus. I don't think you'll find them obtrusive. Once you're in a chart:

* Control-Tab: Starts
* Tab to go down
* Shift-Tab to go up.
* When Done, it'll open up Medications Tab (My Fav!)

Known Issue: This doesn't open the pregnancy module on the health summary. (By design)

I use this about 10x a day already. Really nice to tab though a person's health summary.

At it's most basic, I'd like to make Visit Summaries usable for patients. This seriously doesn't work for me:

By reducing the header, it saves a half a sheet and really simplifies it. It's still not pretty/legible -- reformatting is equally important. But for a few minutes of editing the XSL file, this is a big improvement. Before and after shows:

Using a little bit of css, you  can make something that looks like it's supposed to be printed. I can use some of that saved space to make the outline more obvious and to increase legibility and scanability. (New word...?)

Unfortunately this sort of makeover is limited to printouts. It won't clean up the portal version for  patients. It could be done for portal but e-MDs would have to allow it. And given that there doesn't seem to be any development/changes on portal for several years, I doubt that will happen soon.

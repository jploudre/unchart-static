This report is a simple measure of patient-centered continuity. So, when one of my patients visits the clinic, what's the chance that they saw me for the visit? 1.0 would be every patient sees me; 0.0 would be every patient sees one of my partners. **Contrast:** Doctor-centered continuity would be when I work, how many of the patients I see were mine.

It's a basic percentage of billed office/hospital visits -- new or established patients. There are more sophisticated measures like the [MMCI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3806028) but this is more data/inisight than most practices ever consider.

The report covers the last 365 days before the report and summarizes by month. Like I said in [Data Driven Practice](/2011/data-driven-practice/), the right number of parameters is usually *Zero*. So there's intentionally no options.

### Why does Continuity Rock?

* Cancer patients with low primary care continuity are ~4x more likely to have an ER visit than those with high continuity. [See Pubmed Article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12886178).
* Improves Satisfaction (Patient and Doc)
* Improved Patient Safety ([See Pubmed Article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17327525))
* Improves Quality while reducing cost ([See Pubmed again](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15798043))

---------------------------------

I wish it was that easy: just manage and improve continuity. If you asked me a year ago, access/continuity would have been one of my big successes at my clinic. I had created this and a few other related reports. We had a decent single-page dashboard that you can see in my [data driven practice presentation](/2011/data-driven-practice/). It was a way to use [Practice-based Evidence](/2011/practice-based-evidence/) to improve care.

What happened: it fizzled. My partners and I were originally looking at and thinking about data. In one discussion we got about a minute away from the grail -- we almost made a management experiment using real-time data. We were going to change scheduling to improve the docs who needed the most help. But there was some issues with recent reception stress so we decided to wait. And essentially there's never been any momentum again.

I call this the '**Cowboy Problem**.' You can't fix continuity like a lone cowboy. It takes a team to do it. It doesn't matter how good my reports are if no one is willing to look at them and think. Generally continuity ought to be a responsibility of reception. They are the ones with the power to create continuity by scheduling patients with their doctor. But in most clinics, docs/nurses are afraid of letting reception have the responsibility. "My schedule is full today and I have that difficult patient coming next. That kid with a cough will have to see a partner or go to urgent care."

So don't waste your time downloading the report above -- unless you could actually do something with it. Could you show someone? Get a conversation going? Actually use the data to figure out the problems with how patients are scheduled?

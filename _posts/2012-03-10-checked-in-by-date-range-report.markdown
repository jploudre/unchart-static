Here's a report by Bill Sweeney from Mid-State Health.

 It generates a nice flat file list of appointments that you can select by date. Includes check in time, date, check out time, and optionally who did the check in. 

I love 'flat file' reports like this -- it allows you to do your own analysis in an easier tool like Excel (See my [Data-Driven Practice](/2011/data-driven-practice/) page) With just a few extra columns and a pivot table, I could answer questions like: Are Monday Appointments longer? Do my receptionists share check-in equally?

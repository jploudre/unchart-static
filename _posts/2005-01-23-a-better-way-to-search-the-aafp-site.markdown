Reading through [Google Hacks](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596004478/qid=1076563948//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-5723696-2099150?v=glance&s;=books&n;=507846) and thought of a way to search the AAFP website for articles useful to a Family Doctor (the printable PDFs).

### How did I do it


You can use the 'View Source' option of your web browser on this page. There are 6 lines of HTML that create the search form. The 4th & 5th lines are the cooking-with-gas part. They limit the otherwise large result from google to only PDF files from the AAFP.

Jargon really complicates Meaningful Use discussions. When talking about prescriptions, say, one person might be thinking about the input (CPOE) while another is thinking about transmission (electronic). Or one person talks about clinical decision support while the other hears clinical reporting.

Here's my solution. Print this out huge and put it in your conference room. It's color-coded by major MU goal (improving care is yellow, engaging patients/families is orange, etc)

You might think about having a [Kick Ass Kickoff Meeting](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/kick-ass-kickoff-meetings/) to start explaining Meaningful Use to your whole staff (if you haven't already.) These are the slides I used at our company kickoff.

     Custom Appointment Detail report - being used to track
     appointment visits by reception.  Pulls from appointment 
     data showing types of patient visits, to help with 
     identifying no shows and new patients.
     
That's one of my favorite bits: The best report is one that is actually run repeatedly and actioned.

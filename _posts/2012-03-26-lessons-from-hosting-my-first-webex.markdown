#### Before my first webex, James Foster of e-MDs advised me (paraphrased):

* Mute participants to avoid horrible distraction.
* Have the technical support number handy.
* Embed some music at the start so people don't say, "I don't hear anything, has the webinar started?"
* Start the webinar 30 minutes prior and load the slide deck up
* Don't actually start till 2-3 minutes after the real start because people always run late.

#### Then I decided based on limited experience:

* Separate the video and audio. Using a telephone (ideally
a speakerphone) will probably be more reliable than doing VOIP.
* If you're using a cell -- make sure you've got 2+ hours of talktime battery.
* Make sure you've got a quiet place with good internet.
* Aggressively 'mute' people to keep the audio clean for the recording.

#### Afterwards running my first webex, I also learned:

* VOIP sound quality is better than over the phone.
* I say 'um' a lot.
* When I'm multitasking, my talking takes a massive quality hit.
* Busy-ness: People don't necessarily prepare, even when you tell them to prepare.
* The more I edit myself out of the podcast, the better the quality gets.
* Many people can mute/unmute themselves. Trust people more.
* Storytelling is awesome.
* Discussion is awesome.
* Allow more Q&A.;
* Trust the timeflow more -- don't overcontrol.

When we started eMDs two years ago, we tried to use the Fast Forms that eMDs
had with the system. We were not very successful. We could never get a scanner that
would read the form correctly, and drop it into the note. We also had problems with the
forms themselves. It took a lot of front desk staff time to choose the form, print it, and
give it to the patient. The patients also had problems reading the small print on the forms
and couldn’t fill in the circles well enough for the scanner to read.

## A workaround...

After trying to use the Fast Forms without success, I developed a work around.
We no longer print the form per patient nor do we scan them back in. In fact, we do not
use the Fast Form system at all. Instead, I made preclicks under the ROS to correspond
with each Fast Form. I typed up my own Fast Forms in Word with specific ROS
questions that correspond with the chief complaint. For example, I made individual Fast
Forms for back pain, respiratory illnesses, headache, hypertension/diabetes, etc. We
then pre-print these and have a folder at the front desk. The front desk staff can see what
the patient’s complaint is and give them the appropriate form on a clipboard to fill out
while they are waiting to be called back. The form is now in a larger font so our elderly
patients can read them. We also put the symptoms in laymen’s terms for the patients
to understand (i.e. nosebleed vs. epistaxis).The patient is told to circle any current
symptoms that are listed on the form.

After making my own Fast Forms per chief complaint, I then went and made
preclicks using the Review of Systems Template. For each Fast Form, I made a preclick
with all the negatives checked for each symptom on the form. I then saved these preclicks
for all users to use. We had to make preclicks for adult vs. pediatric and male vs. female.
In the end, we had to make four preclicks for each Fast Form. It took some time in the
beginning to set these preclicks up but in the end it is saving considerable amount of our
nurses’ time.

Now, when the nurse brings the patient back to the room and starts a note, she
simply determines which Fast Form the patient was given. Then chooses the appropriate
preclick with all negatives already marked. Now, all she has to do is change any
symptoms that the patient circled on the Fast Form to be positive. Now the nurses can
quickly document all the positives and pertinent negatives under the Review of Systems.
I have attached all of my Fast Forms that I have made in Word. Feel free to use
them in your practice and make corresponding preclicks in the ROS template. Then
meet with your nursing staff to make a quick workflow adjustment to have your ROS
information added to the visit note in seconds. If you have any questions regarding
my above suggestion for Review of Systems and Fast Forms, please email me at

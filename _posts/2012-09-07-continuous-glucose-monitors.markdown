I started doing CGM about 1.5 years ago but never posted. -- *Jonathan*


CGM Overview
-----------------------

Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) allows for better understanding in hard to control _insulin-dependent_ diabetics. It checks a reading every 5 minutes for 3 days, it's then downloaded and we can use it to adjust isulin and improve diabetic control.

This is a disruptive technology -- as a Family Doc I potentially can do a better job with complicated diabetes control because I have better data from the patient. This is a technology that allows me to broaden the scope of problems I manage before I get to referral.

### Nuts and Bolts

* Why: A1c control is one of our main clinical benchmarks for Meaningful Use.
* Cost: Machine is ~$1200. Sensors are $40 each.
* Coverage: Our carriers cover it. There's $120-200 charge for patient training/explanation (that's outside of the visit E&M;). There's also a $30 interpretation fee after it's removed.
* ROI: The first ~7 patients cover the cost of the machine, if we have ~$200 charges and $40 costs per patient.
* Quality: Allows better diabetic management in insulin patients.
* Time: Most of the process will be nurse driven, like, say, PFTs.

I bought a [Meditronic iPro Continuous Glucose Monitor](http://professional.medtronicdiabetes.com/hcp-products/ipro2).

Since I've been doing it, I've found it to be very useful for seeing exactly where/how sugars are out of control. Essentially every patient has had one significant insight that helped improve diabetes. In Washington State, I think about 70% Private Insurance has coverage. So that's been a barrier to doing it. For patients who don't have coverage, if they might do it several times, I suggest that they consider buying a personal CGM out of pocket. Like [Dexcom Seven Plus](http://www.dexcom.com/seven-plus). It won't be long for someone to make an iPhone compatible personal CGM.....

Appointments Made More than 45 Days Ago. We noticed that a lot of our no-
shows were attributable to patients who made their appointment several months in
advance. Calling these patients 24-48 hours in advance was too late. So no, we
call these patients a week in advance just to give them a heads up. This step
has cut our no-show rate by about 2%.

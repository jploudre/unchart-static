Plan-Do-Study-Act is a methodology for improvement. It's the same basic theory about experimental sciences (hypothesis, experiement, analysis).

Generally it works like this:

1. Plan out how something is supposed to work.
2. Do it
3. Study the results
4. Analyze how to make it better. 
5. Refine Plan.....

For Meaningful Use, I think most organizations would do well to have an explicit process. Written Plan, Written implementations (how's it going to be communicated/trained/etc). One area MU makes life easier is now the studying can be as simple as running the MU reports.

Here's an example of what I'm thinking. We're aiming for a clinic to have 20+ of these for each of the core and most of the menu options.

Smoking status
============

Plan
---------
**Who:** Clinical staff (Nurse/MA)  
**What:** Verify Tobacco Status on patients > 13 years old  
**When:** While rooming, every visit (it's a vital sign.)  
**How:** Ask patient tobacco status. Get to tobacco status either through
CC complaint or through Left Health Summary. If current tobacco status
in chart is not 'orange star' transfer it to orange star section.  If
no changes needed, just click the 'review button'.  
**Why:** Tobacco is a major preventable cause of disease.  
**Goal:** 50% requirement for MU but aiming for >80% like med lists or allergies.  

Doing
---------------------
**Best Practice:** Use Health summary (instead of cc template) after
entering vital signs. Do in the room in real time. (We need to
eliminate post-its for vitals from some nurses.)  
**Best Practice Script:** Q: Why do you ask every time I come in? A:
Tobacco is one of the most important preventable health problems so we
double check all the time. (Note, answer isn't: The goverment told us
to.)  
**Training:** Lead Nurse will personally train 4 nurses, one each from
each pod by Friday.  
**Training:** Each Trainer Nurse will train each nurse/MA in their section
by next Wednesday.  
Any training issues/questions will be communicated to Lead Nurse to
bring back to operations

Reporting
--------------

Will run smoking report in ~10 days (Monday before operations in 2
weeks.) Will just cover from now until then to capture improvement.

Analyzing
--------------

Talking about results posted to see if there's disparity between
providers results or clinical staff follow through.
